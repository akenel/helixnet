# üåå HelixNet Distributed Platform: Task & Data Management
üåå HelixNet Core API: Task & Data Management (v1.2.1)

Congratulations! The initial platform setup for HelixNet is complete. This document serves as the primary source of truth for configuration, deployment, and getting started.
üöÄ Getting Started

Ensure Docker and Make are installed. The project is built around a multi-service Docker Compose architecture.
1. Build & Run the Stack

To build all necessary images, spin up all 12 services (including the database, cache, message broker, MinIO storage, and the helix-web-app), and bring the system online:

make rebuild

(This command stops containers, rebuilds images, and starts fresh.)
2. Initial Data Seeding

After the application starts, it attempts to seed initial users (admin, demo, chuck, marcel, etc.). This ensures you have known accounts for testing and development.

Status Check (as seen in the logs):

    Initial Run: Logs show [helix.auth][INFO] ... ‚ú® Created new account: ...

    Subsequent Runs (safe): Logs show [helix.auth][INFO] ... üëâ Account already exists: ...

To manually trigger or verify the user list at any time, use these commands:

Command
	

Description

make seed-data
	

Runs the user seeding script independently.

make show-users
	

Queries the Postgres database and displays all existing user emails.
üîó Key Local Service Endpoints

The API is served via Traefik.

üí° Best Practice: Development Iteration

When making changes to core logic (like in app/services/user_service.py), the file watcher often detects the change and reloads the application. However, for changes in things like background jobs (jobs.py), always use:

make deploy-code

This ensures the web app, worker, and beat services are all running the latest compiled code.

## üü¢ PROJECT STATUS: CORE PIPELINE ACHIEVED (MILESTONE V0.2.0)

Congratulations, you've made it through the fire. The core distributed architecture‚Äî**FastAPI (API) + Postgres (DB) + Celery (Worker)**‚Äîis **fully functional**. We have confirmed end-to-end processing, job submission triggers a task, and the job status updates from **PENDING** to **COMPLETED** in the database.

### üí• THE HELIXNET MISSION

HelixNet is a robust, asynchronous task and data management platform built on FastAPI, SQLAlchemy (Async), and Celery. It is engineered to handle high-volume data processing and complex, long-running jobs, providing a **secure, scalable backbone** for mission-critical operations.

### üõ†Ô∏è CORE TECHNOLOGY STACK

| Component | Role | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FastAPI** | High-performance API Framework | Operational |
| **PostgreSQL** | Primary Data Persistence | Operational |
| **Celery** | Asynchronous Task Queue / Worker | **Operational (E2E Verified)** |
| **RabbitMQ/Redis** | Celery Broker / Backend | Configured |
| **Security** | JWT, OAuth2, Bcrypt Hashing | **SECURED** |
| **MinIO** | Object Storage (Next Feature) | Ready for Integration |

-----

## ‚ö°Ô∏è CHUCK NORRIS WORKFLOW DEMO

The pipeline is so fast, the data is already processed before the request even leaves the router.

| Status | Description |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **E2E Verified\!** | **Job Flow:** User submits job $\rightarrow$ API saves **PENDING** $\rightarrow$ Celery worker picks up $\rightarrow$ Worker updates to **PROCESSING** (Sync Session) $\rightarrow$ Core logic runs (6s) $\rightarrow$ Worker updates to **COMPLETED** (Sync Session). | |

-----

## ‚öôÔ∏è DEVELOPMENT SETUP (Docker Compose)

### 1\. Prerequisites

  * Docker and Docker Compose
  * `make` utility (for easy command execution)

### 2\. Quick Start

Clone the repository and spin up the stack. This uses the **production-ready architecture** with Celery and Postgres.

```bash
git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL> helixnet
cd helixnet

# Build, deploy, and run the entire stack (API, DB, RabbitMQ, Celery Worker, Flower)
docker compose up --build -d

# Create initial users (admin@helix.net:admin) and apply migrations
make db-init
```

### 3\. Access & Documentation

| Service | Address | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **API Docs (Swagger)** | `http://localhost:8000/docs` | Use this for token generation and API calls. |
| **Celery Flower** | `http://localhost:5555` | Monitor tasks, workers, and job history. |
| **Postgres (pgAdmin)** | (See Docker config) | The helix\_db is running and stable. |

## üó∫Ô∏è CN Product Roadmap (MVP to V1.0)

The focus now shifts to completing the MVP by integrating secure file storage (MinIO) and tightening up the application's final security/async requirements.

| Priority | Feature / Component | Goal (Chuck says: "What is the payoff?") | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P1** | **Artifact Service & MinIO Integration** | **Enable Job Output:** Allow the worker to save the result securely to MinIO, making the job lifecycle complete. | **NEXT** |
| **P2** | **API Security & Docs Polish** | **Production Readiness:** Fix the `tokenUrl` and any remaining 404s in Swagger, ensuring a polished developer experience. | **NEXT** |
| **P3** | **Full Schema Refinement** | **Data Consistency:** Finalize remaining SQLAlchemy models/Pydantic schemas and ensure all database migrations are correct. | TO DO |
| **P4** | **Async Service Layer** | **Future-Proofing:** Refactor core services to use **Async methods** for maximum non-blocking performance. | TO DO |
| **V1.0** | **Real Compute Integration** | **Core Value:** Replace the 6-second sleep placeholder with an actual LLM/heavy computation API call. | GOAL |

Verdict: All essential backend components are wired. The system is ready for E2E validation.
II. Chuck Norris E2E QA Workflow

The following steps must be executed using Swagger UI or a tool like cURL/Postman to verify the entire system, from authentication to final job status.
Prerequisite Verification

Ensure all core services are running:

    FastAPI (API endpoints).

    Postgres (Database persistence).

    Celery Worker (Consumes jobs from the queue).

    MinIO (Stores files).

    Redis/RabbitMQ (Celery broker/backend).

Step 1: Authentication & Token Retrieval

    Endpoint: POST /api/v1/auth/token

    Action: Log in with a valid user (e.g., admin@helix.net).

    Verification: Copy the access_token from the response. This is required for all subsequent steps.

Step 2: List Jobs (Baseline Check)

    Endpoint: GET /api/v1/jobs

    Header: Set Authorization: Bearer [ACCESS_TOKEN]

    Verification: The response should return existing jobs, likely with a PENDING (SHIM) status from previous runs.

Step 3: Submit a File Processing Job (E2E Trigger)

This is the critical test to move from simulated to real processing.

    Endpoint: POST /api/v1/jobs/upload

    Header: Set Authorization: Bearer [ACCESS_TOKEN]

    Body: Upload two files using the multipart/form-data type:

        content_key (name: content_file.txt, value: any text file)

        context_key (name: context_file.txt, value: any text file)

    Verification (FastAPI):

        Response code must be 201 Created.

        Note the returned job_id.

Step 4: Monitor Celery Worker Logs (Real-Time Status Check)

Immediately check the logs of your Celery worker process. You should see this sequence of events, confirming the pipeline execution:

    DB Update: Job [job_id] status updated to IN_PROGRESS.

    MinIO Download: ‚¨áÔ∏è Downloading file for content_key from MinIO key: ...

    Processing: üé¨ Starting mock processing...

    MinIO Upload: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Uploading result artifact to MinIO: .../result.json

    Final DB Update: ‚ú® Job [job_id] completed and final status saved.

If any step fails, the log should show a FAILED status update.
Step 5: Verify Final Status (Data Persistence Check)

    Endpoint: GET /api/v1/jobs

    Header: Set Authorization: Bearer [ACCESS_TOKEN]

    Verification:

        Find the job_id you submitted in Step 3.

        Its status field must now be COMPLETED (not PENDING (SHIM)).

        The job record should now contain the result_path (MinIO key) for the output file.

III. Next Steps (v1.3.0)

With the core processing successfully verified, the next logical step is to improve the user interface:

    Version Increment: Tag the current state as v1.3.0 to mark the completion of the Job Processing Core.

    Dashboard Enhancement: Update the index.html dashboard to:

        Display the real status (IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, FAILED).

        Allow a user to click a job ID to see a detail view, including the MinIO result_path and the result_content payload.

Do you want to run these QA steps and then we can proceed with the version increment and the dashboard enhancements?
