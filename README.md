# üåå HelixNet Distributed Platform: Task & Data Management
üåå HelixNet Core API: Task & Data Management (v1.2.1)

Congratulations! The initial platform setup for HelixNet is complete. This document serves as the primary source of truth for configuration, deployment, and getting started.
üöÄ Getting Started

Ensure Docker and Make are installed. The project is built around a multi-service Docker Compose architecture.
1. Build & Run the Stack

To build all necessary images, spin up all 12 services (including the database, cache, message broker, MinIO storage, and the helix-web-app), and bring the system online:

make rebuild

(This command stops containers, rebuilds images, and starts fresh.)
2. Initial Data Seeding

After the application starts, it attempts to seed initial users (admin, demo, chuck, marcel, etc.). This ensures you have known accounts for testing and development.

Status Check (as seen in the logs):

    Initial Run: Logs show [helix.auth][INFO] ... ‚ú® Created new account: ...

    Subsequent Runs (safe): Logs show [helix.auth][INFO] ... üëâ Account already exists: ...

To manually trigger or verify the user list at any time, use these commands:

Command
	

Description

make seed-data
	

Runs the user seeding script independently.

make show-users
	

Queries the Postgres database and displays all existing user emails.
üîó Key Local Service Endpoints

The API is served via Traefik.

üí° Best Practice: Development Iteration

When making changes to core logic (like in app/services/user_service.py), the file watcher often detects the change and reloads the application. However, for changes in things like background jobs (jobs.py), always use:

make deploy-code

This ensures the web app, worker, and beat services are all running the latest compiled code.

## üü¢ PROJECT STATUS: CORE PIPELINE ACHIEVED (MILESTONE V0.2.0)

Congratulations, you've made it through the fire. The core distributed architecture‚Äî**FastAPI (API) + Postgres (DB) + Celery (Worker)**‚Äîis **fully functional**. We have confirmed end-to-end processing, job submission triggers a task, and the job status updates from **PENDING** to **COMPLETED** in the database.

II. Chuck Norris E2E QA Workflow

The following steps must be executed using Swagger UI or a tool like cURL/Postman to verify the entire system, from authentication to final job status.
Prerequisite Verification

Ensure all core services are running:

    FastAPI (API endpoints).

    Postgres (Database persistence).

    Celery Worker (Consumes jobs from the queue).

    MinIO (Stores files).

    Redis/RabbitMQ (Celery broker/backend).

Step 1: Authentication & Token Retrieval

    Endpoint: POST /api/v1/auth/token

    Action: Log in with a valid user (e.g., admin@helix.net).

    Verification: Copy the access_token from the response. This is required for all subsequent steps.

Step 2: List Jobs (Baseline Check)

    Endpoint: GET /api/v1/jobs

    Header: Set Authorization: Bearer [ACCESS_TOKEN]

    Verification: The response should return existing jobs, likely with a PENDING (SHIM) status from previous runs.

Step 3: Submit a File Processing Job (E2E Trigger)

This is the critical test to move from simulated to real processing.

    Endpoint: POST /api/v1/jobs/upload

    Header: Set Authorization: Bearer [ACCESS_TOKEN]

    Body: Upload two files using the multipart/form-data type:

        content_key (name: content_file.txt, value: any text file)

        context_key (name: context_file.txt, value: any text file)

    Verification (FastAPI):

        Response code must be 201 Created.

        Note the returned job_id.

Step 4: Monitor Celery Worker Logs (Real-Time Status Check)

Immediately check the logs of your Celery worker process. You should see this sequence of events, confirming the pipeline execution:

    DB Update: Job [job_id] status updated to IN_PROGRESS.

    MinIO Download: ‚¨áÔ∏è Downloading file for content_key from MinIO key: ...

    Processing: üé¨ Starting mock processing...

    MinIO Upload: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Uploading result artifact to MinIO: .../result.json

    Final DB Update: ‚ú® Job [job_id] completed and final status saved.

If any step fails, the log should show a FAILED status update.
Step 5: Verify Final Status (Data Persistence Check)

    Endpoint: GET /api/v1/jobs

    Header: Set Authorization: Bearer [ACCESS_TOKEN]

    Verification:

        Find the job_id you submitted in Step 3.

        Its status field must now be COMPLETED (not PENDING (SHIM)).

        The job record should now contain the result_path (MinIO key) for the output file.

III. Next Steps (v1.3.0)

With the core processing successfully verified, the next logical step is to improve the user interface:

    Version Increment: Tag the current state as v1.3.0 to mark the completion of the Job Processing Core.

    Dashboard Enhancement: Update the index.html dashboard to:

        Display the real status (IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, FAILED).

        Allow a user to click a job ID to see a detail view, including the MinIO result_path and the result_content payload.
HelixNet Go-to-Market Strategy: Post-Beta Launch

HelixNet, with its secure user management, data storage, and job orchestration capabilities, is positioned as a powerful platform for streamlining complex, compute-intensive internal processes.

1. Ideal First Customers (The "Beachhead")

The primary initial customers for HelixNet should be smaller departments or mid-sized companies that have internal data silos and recurring, scheduled computational tasks currently being run via fragile scripts or manual processes.

Customer Segment

Why They Are a Good Fit

Core Pain Point Solved

Mid-Market Engineering Consulting Firms

They handle projects with recurring data analysis, needing secure separation between client data and high predictability for job execution. They need an audit trail.

Inconsistent Reporting & Compliance Risk: Fragile scripts and lack of centralized logging for client projects.

Internal Data Science / BI Teams (20-50 employees)

They run nightly ETL jobs, training models, and generating business intelligence reports, often hitting resource limits on general cloud compute services.

"Scheduler Sprawl" & Resource Contention: Jobs fail silently, they waste time debugging execution environments, and lack a central management dashboard.

Specialized Biotech/Pharma Research Labs

They run long, multi-step analysis pipelines (e.g., genome sequencing analysis) that must be restartable, auditable, and secure.

Lack of Reproducibility & Security: Manual restarts of failed pipelines lead to errors; highly sensitive IP needs robust authentication (Keycloak).

2. The Core Value Proposition

HelixNet's value isn't just "running jobs"; it's providing trust and efficiency by removing the unpredictability, non-compliance, and maintenance burden of bespoke internal tools.

Feature

Value Statement

Why They Pay More Than Cloud Functions

Keycloak Integration (Security)

Zero-Friction Compliance: Provides enterprise-grade authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and user auditing out-of-the-box.

Standard serverless often requires complex external IAM/LDAP integration; HelixNet is pre-integrated and hardened.

Robust Job Orchestration

Guaranteed Delivery & Auditability: Tasks are retryable, logged comprehensively, and monitored from a central dashboard, eliminating "silent failures."

Go beyond basic queues (like SQS/Redis). Provide full DAG management, dependency enforcement, and detailed runtime metrics.

Dedicated MinIO/DB Storage

Unified, Secure Data Layer: All job inputs, outputs, and metadata are stored securely and persistently, accessible only via authenticated API endpoints.

No more passing large files between disparate cloud services; data stays local to the compute environment.

3. Pricing Model Recommendation

For a B2B platform like HelixNet, a Value-Based Subscription Model with tiers based on usage limits is the most appropriate and scalable.

Tier

Target Customer

Pricing Structure

Key Limits

Starter (Pilot)

Small Team / Single Department (5-10 users)

$500 - $1,000 / month

Max 10 concurrent jobs; 500 GB MinIO storage; no priority support.

Professional (Standard)

Mid-sized Team / Entire Department (20-50 users)

$3,000 - $5,000 / month

Max 50 concurrent jobs; 2 TB MinIO storage; 4-hour priority support SLA.

Enterprise (Custom)

Large Organization / Mission-Critical Use

Custom Quote ($10k+/month)

Unlimited jobs/storage; dedicated SLA; on-premises/VPC deployment; single sign-on (SSO) integration.

Rationale: The customers are paying for Predictability, Security, and Time Savings, not raw compute time. Pricing by concurrent jobs and data storage aligns with their operational needs and allows the price to scale with the complexity of their business processes.

4. Post-Beta Vision (V2.0 and Beyond)

Once the core HelixNet is stable (Keycloak and job orchestration proven), the focus shifts to ecosystem expansion and integration:

V2.0: Developer Experience & Integrations (The "Ecosystem"):

Focus: Make it trivial for engineers to integrate their code.

Features: Official SDKs for Python/Go, a command-line interface (CLI) for job submission, and native integrations with popular cloud storage services (S3, GCS) for data ingress/egress.

Goal: Move from "Platform for us" to "Platform for Developers."

V3.0: High-Value Analytics (The "Intelligence"):

Focus: Extracting intelligence from the job data HelixNet already collects.

Features: Automated Cost Attribution (which job/team consumed which resources), predictive failure analysis (using job history to forecast where the next failure will occur), and automatic resource scaling recommendations.

Goal: Transition from a pure execution layer to a Cost Management and Optimization Platform.
