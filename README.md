# üåå HelixNet Core API: Task & Data Management

This repository contains the core services for HelixNet, designed for high-volume data processing and task management using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ/Celery, and Redis, all orchestrated via Docker Compose and secured with Traefik.

## üöÄ Deployment & Access

The entire application stack is containerized using Docker Compose. Access to all web services is managed via **Traefik**, utilizing HTTPS and custom hostnames defined in your local `/etc/hosts` file.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Docker & Docker Compose:** Must be installed and running.
2.  **Hostnames:** You must add the following entries to your local machine's `/etc/hosts` file, mapping them to your Traefik entry point (usually the IP address of the machine running Docker, or `127.0.0.1`):

    ```
    127.0.0.1  helix.local
    127.0.0.1  flower.helix.local
    127.0.0.1  pgadmin.helix.local
    # ... any other Traefik-routed services
    ```

### Access Points

Once the stack is running via `docker-compose up -d`, services are available via HTTPS:

| Service | Access URL | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core API (FastAPI)** | `https://helix.local/` | Main application endpoint. |
| **Swagger Docs** | `https://helix.local/docs` | Interactive API documentation. |
| **Flower Dashboard** | `https://flower.helix.local/` | Celery task monitoring and worker management. |
| **PGAdmin** | `https://pgadmin.helix.local/` | PostgreSQL database administration GUI. |

### Database Setup

To prepare the database and seed initial users (required before API testing):

1.  Start the services: `docker-compose up -d`
2.  Run the setup command: `make setup` (This executes migrations and seeding).

üåå HelixNet Core API: Task & Data Management
üõ†Ô∏è Overview

This is the core service for high-volume data processing and user management, built with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and Celery for asynchronous job handling.

This API adheres to the standard versioning prefix /api/v1 for all application routes (Authentication, Users, Jobs), with the exception of the system health check.
üöÄ Getting Started

The API is fully self-documenting. Once the server is running, you can access the interactive Swagger UI documentation here:

    API Docs (Swagger UI): [Your Host]/docs

    OpenAPI Specification: [Your Host]/openapi.json

üîê Authentication (OAuth2)

All protected routes require a Bearer Token obtained via the OAuth2 Password flow.
1. Get an Access Token

Endpoint
	

Method
	

Description

/api/v1/token
	

POST
	

Exchange username (email) and password for a JWT Access Token.

Request Example (using curl):

curl -X POST \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=marcel@helix.net&password=yourpassword"

2. Use the Token

Use the returned access_token in the Authorization header of all subsequent requests:
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>
üë§ User Management (/api/v1/)

The User endpoints handle standard CRUD operations and require an active Bearer Token.
