# üåå HelixNet Core API: Task & Data Management

## ü•ã PROJECT STATUS: AUTHENTICATION SECURED (MILESTONE V1.0.0)

Congratulations, you've made it through the fire. The core security and authentication system is **clean, centralized, and fully operational**. User login, JWT token generation, and secure dependency injection are battle-tested and ready for the next phase.

### üí• THE HELIXNET MISSION

HelixNet is a robust, asynchronous task and data management platform built on FastAPI, SQLAlchemy (Async), and Celery. It is engineered to handle high-volume data processing and complex, long-running jobs, providing a secure, scalable backbone for mission-critical operations.

### üõ†Ô∏è CORE TECHNOLOGY STACK

| Component | Role | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FastAPI** | High-performance API Framework | Operational |
| **PostgreSQL** | Primary Data Persistence (Async) | Operational |
| **Celery** | Asynchronous Task Queue / Worker | Ready for Integration |
| **RabbitMQ/Redis** | Celery Broker / Backend | Configured |
| **Security** | JWT, OAuth2, Bcrypt Hashing | **CLEAN & SECURED** |
