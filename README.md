üåü HelixNet Platform: The Asynchronous Architecture

This repository contains the foundation for the HelixNet asynchronous web platform, utilizing FastAPI, Celery, and a full suite of containerized backend services for high-performance, real-world application development.
‚úÖ CURRENT STATUS: TECHNICAL SPIKE COMPLETE (MVA)

The core infrastructure connection is verified and working. The local Python environment is successfully communicating with the Dockerized Postgres database.

    Endpoint Verified: GET /health returns 200 OK (Postgres connectivity confirmed).

    Database Verified: CRUD operations (POST/GET) on the /items endpoint successfully save and retrieve data from the helix_db database.

üöß Immediate Roadmap: Refactoring & Unit Verification

Our next steps are to move the code from the single testing file (app/api/services/check_api.py) into the final, clean structure, verifying the system health (/health endpoint) after each move.

Step
	

Focus
	

Action
	

Verification

R1
	

Database Core
	

Move engine, Base, and get_db_session logic into app/db/database.py.
	

RUN: uvicorn check_api:app --reload. TEST: GET /health must return 200 OK.

R2
	

ORM Models
	

Move the Item SQLAlchemy model into app/db/models.py.
	

RUN: uvicorn check_api:app --reload. TEST: GET /health must return 200 OK.

R3
	

Pydantic Schemas
	

Move the Item Pydantic models into app/schemas/item_schema.py.
	

RUN: uvicorn check_api:app --reload. TEST: GET /health must return 200 OK.

R4
	

API Router
	

Move all routes (/health, /items) into a new file: app/api/item_router.py and delete the testing file.
	

RUN: uvicorn app.main:app --reload (Finally using main.py). TEST: GET /health must return 200 OK.

HelixNet Core API

The Asynchronous Enterprise-Grade Backend for Scalable Job Processing.

This project utilizes a modern microservices-inspired architecture running on Docker Compose, integrating FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Celery, RabbitMQ, Redis, and MinIO.
üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup Guide: The Vibe Coder's Ritual

The HelixNet environment is separated into two layers:

    The Infrastructure Layer (Docker): Contains all persistent services (Postgres, RabbitMQ, Redis, MinIO). These run in containers and communicate internally.

    The Application Layer (Local Venv): Contains the actual Python code (main.py, routers, services). We run this outside Docker during development so you can use features like Uvicorn's --reload and use a debugger, but it connects into the Docker network.

The Standard 3-Step Ritual to start local development (REQUIRED):
1. üèóÔ∏è Create & Activate the Venv (The Local Toolbox)

This command creates and activates your isolated Python environment, ensuring you are using the correct dependencies and versions listed in requirements.txt.

# 1a. Create the venv (if it doesn't exist)
python3 -m venv venv

# 1b. Activate the venv (do this every time you start a new terminal session)
source venv/bin/activate
# You should see: (venv) angel@debian:~/repos/helixnet$

2. üì¶ Install Dependencies (Fill the Toolbox)

This installs Uvicorn, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and all other necessary libraries into your new, active virtual environment.

(venv) angel@debian:~/repos/helixnet$ pip install -r requirements.txt

3. üöÄ Run the Infrastructure & API
A. Start the Backend Services (Docker Stack)

Ensure all essential services are running in the background.

docker compose up -d

B. Run the FastAPI Application (Local Development)

This starts your application, enables code reloading, and connects it to the live Docker services.

(venv) angel@debian:~/repos/helixnet$ uvicorn app.main:app --reload

C. Troubleshooting Port Conflicts (Address already in use)
If you get the [Errno 98] Address already in use error, it means port 8000 is already taken by another process (often a previous failed run or a running Docker container).

 Use these "secret instructions" to fix it:
 
 Find the Process ID (PID):# This command lists the process listening on port 8000

sudo lsof -i :8000

Identify the PID:

 Look in the output for the column labeled PID.
 
 Kill the Process: 
 
 Replace {PID} with the number you found.# This forcefully terminates the conflicting process

sudo kill -9 {PID}

Rerun the app: 
Go back to Step 3B and run uvicorn app.main:app --reload again.
