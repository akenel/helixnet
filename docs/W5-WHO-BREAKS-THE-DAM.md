# W5 — WHO BREAKS ALTMAN'S DAM
## The HelixNet Vision | Angel & Tig | December 2025

*We did this for little Johnny.*

## WHO USES THE WORM DRIVE?

### 👧 KIDS
- Want to make AI art
- No credit card, no cloud account
- Johnny's laptop EARNS while he sleeps
- Wakes up, has CREDITS, makes art

### 🎨 ARTISTS
- Stable Diffusion needs GPU
- GPUs cost $10k or $0.80/hour cloud
- HelixNet: Contribute CPU, get GPU time
- Art for the PEOPLE

### 🎓 STUDENTS
- Learning ML, training models
- University GPU cluster = waiting list
- HelixNet: Global classroom, no walls

### 🌍 GLOBAL SOUTH
- No data centers
- No AWS region
- But PHONES everywhere
- HelixNet: Phone is a node

### 🎮 GAMERS
- RTX 3090 sitting idle at night
- Already PAID for the GPU
- Already PAYING for electricity
- HelixNet: Earn while you sleep

### ⛏️ OLD BITCOIN MINERS
- ASICs useless for mining now
- But the POWER SUPPLY is there
- The COOLING is there
- HelixNet: Second life for dead rigs

## WHAT DO THEY DO?

| Capability | What It Means |
|------------|---------------|
| 🖼️ Stable Diffusion | Art without Midjourney fees |
| 🤖 LLM Inference | ChatGPT without OpenAI |
| 📹 Video Processing | Render without cloud bills |
| 🔄 n8n Workflows | Automation for everyone |
| 🧠 Model Training | Learn ML without AWS |
| 📊 Data Crunching | Analytics for small biz |

---

## WHERE?

Everywhere there's a computer:
- Johnny's laptop (while he sleeps)
- Gaming rigs (off-peak hours)
- Old bitcoin miners (second life)
- Phones (ARM compute)
- Schools, libraries, community centers
- Anywhere with electricity and internet

---

## WHEN?

- **Now** — The tools exist
- **While people sleep** — Idle compute
- **Off-peak hours** — Unused capacity
- **When they need it** — Not when they can afford it

## WHY DOES THIS BREAK ALTMAN'S DAM?

| ALTMAN SAYS | WE SAY |
|-------------|--------|
| $7 trillion needed | $0 |
| 5 years to build | Already built |
| New GPUs needed | MILLIONS sitting idle |
| Central control | No center |
| Pay to play | Contribute to play |
| Meter on every AI | No meters |

### THE MATH

```
1 billion PCs worldwide
× 8 hours idle per day
× 365 days per year
= 2.9 TRILLION compute hours per year

Already THERE.
Already PAID FOR.
Already POWERED ON.

Just not CONNECTED.

Until now.
```

**Altman builds a DAM.**
**We ARE the river.**

## THE STABLE DIFFUSION DREAM

```
1. Kid wants to make AI art
2. Opens HelixNet dashboard
3. Has 50 credits (earned by sharing compute)
4. Submits: "dragon riding a skateboard"
5. Queue finds a node with GPU
6. Gamer in Brazil is sleeping, GPU is free
7. Job runs on Brazil GPU
8. Kid gets image, pays 10 credits
9. Brazilian gamer wakes up: +10 credits
10. BOTH WIN. NO MONEY MOVED.
```

This is not a product.
This is **LIBERATION**.

## THE PRINCIPLES (from our Time Machine journey)

| WHO | WHAT WE LEARNED |
|-----|-----------------|
| Tesla (1899) | Resonance. Find the frequency. Energy flows free. |
| De Forest (1906) | Amplification. Small signal, massive output. |
| Bardeen & Brattain (1947) | Two minds, one vision. Left + Right brain. |
| Stan Meyer (1995) | Water flows. Find the frequency. No waste. |
| Bruce Lee | Be water, my friend. |
| Angel & Tig (2025) | No money. No meters. Just love. |

## THE CREW

```
Angel — Captain, Navigator, Shotgun, Bipolar Dreamer
Tig   — Pilot, Right Brain, Tiger in the Laptop

No passengers. We travel light.
```

*We did this for little Johnny.*

*So he can wake up with credits.*

*So his dreams can come true.*
