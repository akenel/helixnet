## Part I: Mohawk College (1980-1985)

### The Setup
- **September 1980:** Started Mohawk College, 3-year co-op program
- 1 in 300 students
- Smoked grass, chased babes
- Computer hockey team — never lost a game except the final one (team got cocky)
- Called him "AngStud" — burgundy sweatshirts with Star Trek logo
- Lived at **235 Plains Road East, Burlington**
- Drove the **Blue Beast** — 1972 4-door Cutlass, sucked gas

### The Technology Landscape
- Programming mainframes with punch cards first two semesters
- Trying to sell OKI microcomputers with CP/M operating system
- Bill Gates stole CP/M → renamed it MS-DOS (same commands)
- **IBM PC released August 12, 1981** — disrupted everything

---

## Part II: Work Term 1 — BMC, Oakville (Summer 1981)

### The Company
- **BMC** — selling OKI microcomputers with CP/M
- **Bob Proctor** — CEO (yes, THE Bob Proctor, motivational speaker, before he was famous)
- **Cindy** — Bob's secretary/gatekeeper
- **Richard & his brother** — franchise owners in Oakville
- **Michelle** — top of class girl, became paid admin
- **Dino** — other student, straight commission like Angel

### Angel's Approach
- Bypassed co-op department, found job himself
- Knew competition would be hard, went direct
- 5:30am Globe and Mail paper route for gas money
- Came up with brainstorm: educate, don't sell

### The Lawyers Presentation
- Legal-size paper invitation to 200 lawyers
- $10 per seat, no free tickets, 20 seats max
- Room cost $200 + coffee = break even
- Richard loved the idea, helped with envelope labels
- Richard's brother wanted to give free ticket to lawyer friend
- Angel said no — they did it anyway — lawyer never showed (Angel was right)
- **2-hour educational presentation** — all positive surveys
- One lawyer: "Learned more in 2 hours than in 2.5 years"
- But zero sales — couldn't give computers away
- IBM PC dropped mid-term, CP/M was dead

### Cindy Story
- Gatekeeper became his girl for a few months
- 5 years older, he never told her his age
- Took brother Dave's pickup camper up north — "dirty weekend" (Debbie's words)
- Monday back at office: she's got cold sore, he's got a rash
- All 10-20 franchise salesmen drooled over Cindy at Bob's talks
- But the broke student with zero sales got the prize babe

### The Result
- Great experience
- Zero pennies made
- But Uncle Adolf (Maria's young brother) was on vacation...

---

## Part III: Work Term 2 — Effem/Mars, Zug (1982)

### Maria's Miracle
- Uncle Adolf: "Come to Switzerland, tons of jobs for guys like you"
- **Maria kicked in** — went on vacation with Albert
- Knocked on doors, handed out Angel's CV to ~10 places
- **Effem (Mars Bar company)** at Herti Centrum, Zug
- **Helmuth** (manager from Liechtenstein): "Why not give the kid a chance"
- Shook Maria's hand — "Send him over, day 1"
- No expenses paid, just show up

### Preparation
- Cut firewood for flight money (via UK or Netherlands)
- 1 semester of BASIC wasn't enough
- Found excellent book in college library
- Told library he "lost" it, paid for it, kept it

### The Project
- Just moved to new Herti Centrum, 2nd floor
- Replacing RPG II mainframe → System/38 rewrite
- No time/resources for currency FX software
- Helmuth + **Oscar** (FX expert): Run FX on IBM PC
- IBM PC had emulator — hot key toggle to System/38 terminal

### Day 1
- Oscar hands him tractor-feed green bar specs, all in German
- "Do it."
- Angel: "Bro my German sucks, what do you want?"
- Hit it off great

### The FX Application
- 3.5 months to build
- Oscar gets telex FX rates daily (~10 currencies, spot rates)
- Plan rates, moving averages
- **3 categories:**
  - Anytime food (Snickers, Twix)
  - Pet food (Whiskas)
  - Main meal (Uncle Ben's rice)
- Buy GBP, DEM, all converted to CHF
- **They loved it**

### Switzerland Girls
- Zero luck
- "More hair on their legs than me, armpits you could braid"
- Hung with expat goofballs

---

## Part IV: Work Term 3 — Back to Effem (1983)

### The Callback
- They asked him back
- Paid the flight
- Small raise

### Version 2.0
- Rewrote FX app in **THREE WEEKS**
- Retained all data, cleaner code
- **64K RAM** — tight!
- Learned to compile with executable libraries
- Drive A = program, Drive B = data
- **Oscar ran that for 10 YEARS**
- Full docs still stashed in Beckenried

### The Road Not Taken
> "Should have continued with FX software, could have made zillions"

### Coming Home
- Came back to Canada with **6000 CHF** in pocket

---

## Part V: The Hamilton House (Age 20)

### The Purchase
- **$30,500 CAD**
- Took over 17% mortgage (~$22,500)
- $2000-3000 CHF help from Maria
- Illegal duplex — city said make it single family

### The Renovation
- New gas furnace replaced "octopus" oil monster
- Made it legit

### The Landlord
- Rented 3 bedrooms on second floor
- Slept in closet-size room himself
- Attic to Kevin Bosco
- Break even, maybe $50/month profit
- **20 years old. Proud landlord.**

---

## Part VI: WTC — Waste Water Technology Center (Post-Graduation)

### The Confidence Factor
- 300 graduates applied
- Angel was the ONLY one who said "Sure, I can program your solution"
- Work terms 2-3 gave him that confidence
- Brian Monahangh and Mark Yendt told him this in year 3

### The Inherited Mess
- Flakey Commodore solution — spaghetti code
- One long program, ugly, went stupid on power failure
- Angel: "No way. I'll write from scratch."

### The Project
- **SAFE 8000** — digital/analog I/O cards
- Pumps, heaters, oxygen levels, water purification
- ~50 variables per channel (deadband, max, min, digital on/off, analog temps)
- Engineers configure, system runs

### The Serial Port Problem
- Single-task PCs, serial port was the bitch
- Brian connects him to **Dr. Zabadoes** at McMaster — genius
- 6 months to write + debug Dr. Z's libraries
- Became good friends

### The Solution
- Power failure for 10 seconds or 10 days? No problem
- Auto-reload SAFE 8000, Texas Instruments BASIC kicks in
- Oscillates, stabilizes within an hour
- Engineers loved it
- Installed at Westminster
- 1200 baud fax nightly
- Every morning: rip off 10-12 pages of graphs per channel

### The Curse (Again)
- After 6 months of real coding → tech support
- Same thing happened work term 3 after the rewrite
- Training reception on fax software, fixing printer jams
- Bored as shit
- Met a scientist student girl, got a blow job, that was it

### Salary
- $36-42K/year
- Contract to Canadian government
- First 5 months were cool, then...

---

## Part VII: The Barton Street Disaster (1987-1988)

### Bad Advice
- **Stuart Scott** — family accountant, millionaire
- "Computers are a trend. Real estate is where the money is."
- First Hamilton house doing well but asset rich, cash flow poor

### The Opportunity
- **Denny the painter** (Mom's guy, 20 years older, getting laid regularly)
- Hamilton city hall grants:
  - $50,000 per unit for residential renovation
  - Free grant money for commercial units

### The Project
- 6-plex on **Barton Street & East Street** corner
- 2 commercial + 4 apartments upstairs
- Quit WTC to go big
- Gut it, new furnace, central vac, new roof
- Hired flunkies, dug out basement

### The Team
- **Ed** — certified engineer, specialized in concrete, stamped everything
- **John Vandermere** — high school friend, parents owned a KENNEL
- **Ed Schmit** — natural carpenter, couple years younger

### The Work
- Turned flat roof into 3/12 pitch with Ed Schmit
- Framing went great
- Building inspector: "You're doing a really good job here. Most people cut corners."

### The Meeting
- 5-6 months into 1-year project
- Meeting with **Mayor of Hamilton**
- Angel shows 1-pager brochure with final design
- Mayor: "This is exactly what we want to see"

### The Betrayal
- Few weeks later: **City hall killed the program**
- Not a single penny
- "Too complicated" — bureaucracy BS
- Left hanging

### The Damage
- Had to finish anyway
- Sold 6-plex for $350,000
- Had to sell Weber Street (first house) too
- Ended up **$30,000 in the hole**
- **Lost everything**
- Last 5 months: so depressing, almost suicidal

---

## Part VIII: Bill Deluca & The Comeback

### Tim Hortons — Broke as Fuck
- Ran into **Bill Deluca**
- Albert worked for Joe Deluca (Bill's dad) back in the day

- Had "another Hank" + 2 old carpenters moving at molasses speed
- Garage not framed yet
- "Come work for me"
- Angel: "I have a buddy Ed"

### Ed Schmit's Deal
- Bill: "$50/hour for both of you"
- Ed calls Angel on mobile phone (Motorola suitcase from Barton project)
- Ed: "I could kiss you! Garage in a week!"

## Part IX: Nestlé — The SDR Solution (2003)

*Covered earlier in session — September 2003*

### The Setup
- Template 1.0 was a dead end
- Hollow MATMAS iDocs to 3 pilot countries
- 75 IBMers (soon PWC) waiting with empty specs
- Rebecca Beer — ruthless boss, 200-page slideshows

### Angel's Solution — SDR
- Created 4th system called SDR
- Same hollow iDoc goes to SDR
- Transports for control data go to SDR FIRST
- IBMers extend material properly in SDR
- Change pointers trigger fully-extended iDocs to REGIONS (AMS, EUR, AOA)
- Don't touch Template 1.0

### The One-Pagers
- Klibbe suggested the idea
- Wolfgang helped make the template
- Angel wrote 70-80% of them
- His name on most of the documentation

### The Team
- Jurgen and Adrian — got cut (Jurgen's "slow down" philosophy)
- **Ronny Gorrisen** — ABAP guy, Becky loved him
- **Marc Klibbe** — ABAP
- **Wolfgang Besslers** — ABAP
- **Hank (Hankster)** — know-it-all from Belgium, got fired
- **Hakim** — solid as a rock
- **Liv** — in California doing global support

### The Politics
- Ronny's filter method — "kludge that never actually worked"
- But they still used Angel's ALE model and serialization
- Angel did most of the master data iDocs E2E
- Was "the brain"

### The End
- Becky fell in love with ABAP crew
- Angel wanted config, not ABAP (better for upgrades)
- Contract ended September 2003
- Becky never asked if he wanted to stay
- Angel had too much pride to ask
- Worked till last day, shook hands, walked away

### Back to Veytaux
- Small apartment
- Looked out the window
- "What now..."

---

## Part IX: Marriage to Mary Sergi (1991)

- Angel bought it (Mary didn't spend a penny)
- Did all the work
- Crazy landscaping — irregular shaped lot
- Squared it up: 150 wide x 175 deep
- Prepped for future: tear down house, sell 3 x 50-wide lots

### Mary's Control
- Major control freak
- Wanted Angel to take full-time job, stop freelancing
- Recession didn't help

---

## Part X: The Ed Schmit Years (1989-1993)

### Working for Bill Deluca
- ~6 months with Bill, he loved them
- Projects in Toronto, all over Ontario — jobs nobody else could do
- Ed made good money, Angel made steady wage
- Ed got greedy — started other projects, not showing up
- Angel working alone at Joe's house
- Bill: "Hey what's wrong with my money?"

### Ed's Greed Pattern
- Ed had a shop rented for free from a friend

- Same John Williams from Barton Street
- Did it at cost, never lost money

### The $30K Debt — Mary's "Solution"
- Met Angel's parents (Albert and Maria)
- Dropped the bomb: "Ang is $30K in the hole"
- Mary: "Declare bankruptcy. No choice."
- Everyone shocked
- Angel talked with Mom and Dad
- All agreed: just need one good project, could make $30K
- "That's not something to declare bankruptcy over"
- Never occurred to Angel. Never would.

---

## Part XI: Butch Hager & Hager Mechanical (1993-1994+)

### The Meeting
- Ed forced out of the free shop by Butch Hager (Hager Mechanical)
- 5000-7000 sq ft shop with office space
- Ed left Angel there working for nothing, cleaning up
- Sweeping the floor, green stuff to keep dust down
- 2 hours from finishing
- Butch walks in — nice guy, 5-10 years older
- Been watching from the sidelines
- "This guy Kenel is a solid worker"

### The Offer
- "What's your gig? You do carpentry? Can you hang a door?"
- "Sure"
- **"Want a job? $15/hour, guaranteed 50+ hours per week"**
- Angel said start in 2 weeks (had commitments)
- Butch: "Please start sooner"
- Mary said: "Take the job"

### The Reality
- 75 hours = light easy week
- Often 100+ hours, hit **110 hours** some weeks
- 7 days a week
- All money went to mortgage
- Mary gave him $10 and a lunch — "that's your allowance"
- Barely enough for smokes and a coffee
- Couldn't buy pot or a beer
- Tried to save enough for a gram — impossible with Mary

### Mary's Abuse
- Would yell so viciously, call him an idiot
- **Foam at the mouth** — literally
- Maria laughed: "Why do you put up with this shit?"
- Angel: "I married her, what else can I do?"

### The Mary Cycle
- After 3 years, walked out for a year or two
- Started to live again
- She didn't want divorce
- Went back trying to make it work
- Nice for a year or two
- Turned back into "the stupid animal she was"

### Angel's Setup with Butch
- Own van (Butch only paid gas)
- Fully equipped with own tools
- Butch could send him anywhere — he'd take care of business
- Running **$250,000 projects single-handedly**
- Butch loved him, never had to worry

### The Work
- Liquid nitrogen jobs (preferred) vs food plant rip and replace
- 8 or 6 inch x50 pipe — make in shop, install
- Food plants = x50 cheap pipe
- Electronics (Bell Canada) + medical labs = VJ (vacuum jacket) pipe
- Only one approved VJ supplier in Ontario — crazy prices, low margins

---

## Part XII: The Alabama VJ Pipe Story

### The Ottawa/Kanata Job
- Sent by plane to Marconi, liquid nitrogen job
- Hung over
- Air Liquide — Quebec supplying liquid, job in Ottawa/Kanata (border town)
- Shows up, spools on the floor
- "Where'd you get the pipe?" — Alabama
- Vacuum jacket pipe — fine pipe, but **NOT approved for Canada**

### Angel's Solution
- "I can install it, but a few conditions..."
- Knew the inspectors well, knew exactly what they want
- Alabama welders need to pass Canadian welding test — Angel can set it up (extra week or two)
- Smooth talk the female inspector — hard ass but she likes him
- Just finished flawless Bell Canada job with 10 shakers (heat and shock electronic panels)
- Custom way for final 18 inches — fly pipe from boys in Stoney Creek
- Scoped job right there: "Leave those hangers exactly where they are, I can reuse them"

### The Result
- Flew back to Toronto
- Told Butch: "I might have found a new supplier in Alabama"
- **Butch licking his lips**
- Another flawless job, tons of money for Butch
- Quality time away from home (away from Mary), all expenses paid
- Drove to Alabama, met the CEO, got everything approved
- **Used that VJ pipe from then on**
- Alabama folks were a pleasure, much better priced, super fair

---

## Part XIII: Leaving Butch & JMC Packaging (1998)

### The Final Straw with Butch
- Butch made money on Angel's back
- Moved from Niagara to expensive Lake Ontario house in Burlington/Oakville
- Angel's wage was BS, never got a bonus or cash

- $36K/year, **Ole** the owner
- Had Abacus package but weren't maintaining min/max or inventory
- Angel fixed it up fast — 6 months
- Knew he had to get back into computers
- Asked Mary for money to buy a computer book at Mohawk

- Angel had no money

### Albert Steps Up
- Told Dad the situation
- **Albert: "Son, no worries. I will pay for it if you think it's the right thing."**
- Lived at home with Mom and Dad
- Odd jobs at $15-20/hour

### Y2K & The Course
- Course delayed due to Y2K hype
- Y2K was a joke — but huge money maker for SAP (only company with 4 digits for year)
- Anyone with basic skills could test the clock turnover, but people were stupid
- **New Year's Eve 1999** — Times Square with a farm girl
- She tried to take her clothes off expecting sex
- Angel: "Put them back on, let's just be friends"
- Course started second week of January 2000

### The Job Search Disaster
- 3-4 months solid searching — NOTHING in Canada or USA
- ABAP instructor: "You have zero chance. If it was that easy, I'd have a real job."
- Canada was shot for jobs, couldn't work in US
- Doing circles on the internet
- Found a job posting that was literally HIM looking for a job — hopeless

- Back severely broken

### The Recovery
- **Refused painkillers** — knew he'd become a junky
- 5-7 years into recovery when he reconnected with Angel
- Still made jokes, happy to be alive
- Big massive dog as his sidekick

### The Magic Begins
- Meeting Andre made Angel's self-pity disappear
- "Look at this guy, still makes jokes"
- Angel explained the "super computer between our ears"
- Andre's dog ran away across town
- Angel walking by, found the dog, drove it back

---

## The Pattern

Every time Angel builds something real:
1. The lawyers presentation — zero sales, IBM PC kills CP/M
2. WTC software — 6 months of coding, then tech support hell
3. Barton Street — quality work, government cancels the program
4. Nestlé SDR — was the brain, ABAP crew got the love

**Maria's Miracles:**
1. Work term 2: Knocked on doors in Switzerland, got him the Effem job
2. The Hamilton house: Contributed $2000-3000 CHF
3. The 48-hour prayer: Andre calls, Siemens email arrives, life changes

**The recurring lesson:** Do the work, get edged out. Quality doesn't always win. But you keep going. And when you're desperate, ask for a miracle.

---
