## Part I: Mohawk College (1980-1985)

### The Setup
- **September 1980:** Started Mohawk College, 3-year co-op program
- 1 in 300 students
- Smoked grass, chased babes
- Computer hockey team — never lost a game except the final one (team got cocky)
- Called him "AngStud" — burgundy sweatshirts with Star Trek logo
- Lived at **235 Plains Road East, Burlington**
- Drove the **Blue Beast** — 1972 4-door Cutlass, sucked gas

### The Technology Landscape
- Programming mainframes with punch cards first two semesters
- Trying to sell OKI microcomputers with CP/M operating system
- Bill Gates stole CP/M → renamed it MS-DOS (same commands)
- **IBM PC released August 12, 1981** — disrupted everything

---

## Part II: Work Term 1 — BMC, Oakville (Summer 1981)

### The Company
- **BMC** — selling OKI microcomputers with CP/M
- **Bob Proctor** — CEO (yes, THE Bob Proctor, motivational speaker, before he was famous)
- **Cindy** — Bob's secretary/gatekeeper
- **Richard & his brother** — franchise owners in Oakville
- **Michelle** — top of class girl, became paid admin
- **Dino** — other student, straight commission like Angel

### Angel's Approach
- Bypassed co-op department, found job himself
- Knew competition would be hard, went direct
- 5:30am Globe and Mail paper route for gas money
- Came up with brainstorm: educate, don't sell

### The Lawyers Presentation
- Legal-size paper invitation to 200 lawyers
- $10 per seat, no free tickets, 20 seats max
- Room cost $200 + coffee = break even
- Richard loved the idea, helped with envelope labels
- Richard's brother wanted to give free ticket to lawyer friend
- Angel said no — they did it anyway — lawyer never showed (Angel was right)
- **2-hour educational presentation** — all positive surveys
- One lawyer: "Learned more in 2 hours than in 2.5 years"
- But zero sales — couldn't give computers away
- IBM PC dropped mid-term, CP/M was dead

### Cindy Story
- Gatekeeper became his girl for a few months
- 5 years older, he never told her his age
- Took brother Dave's pickup camper up north — "dirty weekend" (Debbie's words)
- Monday back at office: she's got cold sore, he's got a rash
- All 10-20 franchise salesmen drooled over Cindy at Bob's talks
- But the broke student with zero sales got the prize babe

### The Result
- Great experience
- Zero pennies made
- But Uncle Adolf (Maria's young brother) was on vacation...

---

## Part III: Work Term 2 — Effem/Mars, Zug (1982)

### Maria's Miracle
- Uncle Adolf: "Come to Switzerland, tons of jobs for guys like you"
- **Maria kicked in** — went on vacation with Albert
- Knocked on doors, handed out Angel's CV to ~10 places
- **Effem (Mars Bar company)** at Herti Centrum, Zug
- **Helmuth** (manager from Liechtenstein): "Why not give the kid a chance"
- Shook Maria's hand — "Send him over, day 1"
- No expenses paid, just show up

### Preparation
- Cut firewood for flight money (via UK or Netherlands)
- 1 semester of BASIC wasn't enough
- Found excellent book in college library
- Told library he "lost" it, paid for it, kept it

### The Project
- Just moved to new Herti Centrum, 2nd floor
- Replacing RPG II mainframe → System/38 rewrite
- No time/resources for currency FX software
- Helmuth + **Oscar** (FX expert): Run FX on IBM PC
- IBM PC had emulator — hot key toggle to System/38 terminal

### Day 1
- Oscar hands him tractor-feed green bar specs, all in German
- "Do it."
- Angel: "Bro my German sucks, what do you want?"
- Hit it off great

### The FX Application
- 3.5 months to build
- Oscar gets telex FX rates daily (~10 currencies, spot rates)
- Plan rates, moving averages
- **3 categories:**
  - Anytime food (Snickers, Twix)
  - Pet food (Whiskas)
  - Main meal (Uncle Ben's rice)
- Buy GBP, DEM, all converted to CHF
- **They loved it**

### Switzerland Girls
- Zero luck
- "More hair on their legs than me, armpits you could braid"
- Hung with expat goofballs

---

## Part IV: Work Term 3 — Back to Effem (1983)

### The Callback
- They asked him back
- Paid the flight
- Small raise

### Version 2.0
- Rewrote FX app in **THREE WEEKS**
- Retained all data, cleaner code
- **64K RAM** — tight!
- Learned to compile with executable libraries
- Drive A = program, Drive B = data
- **Oscar ran that for 10 YEARS**
- Full docs still stashed in Beckenried

### The Road Not Taken
> "Should have continued with FX software, could have made zillions"

### Coming Home
- Came back to Canada with **6000 CHF** in pocket

---

## Part V: The Hamilton House (Age 20)

### The Purchase
- **$30,500 CAD**
- Took over 17% mortgage (~$22,500)
- $2000-3000 CHF help from Maria
- Illegal duplex — city said make it single family

### The Renovation
- New gas furnace replaced "octopus" oil monster
- Made it legit

### The Landlord
- Rented 3 bedrooms on second floor
- Slept in closet-size room himself
- Attic to Kevin Bosco
- Break even, maybe $50/month profit
- **20 years old. Proud landlord.**

---

## Part VI: WTC — Waste Water Technology Center (Post-Graduation)

### The Confidence Factor
- 300 graduates applied
- Angel was the ONLY one who said "Sure, I can program your solution"
- Work terms 2-3 gave him that confidence
- Brian Monahangh and Mark Yendt told him this in year 3

### The Inherited Mess
- Flakey Commodore solution — spaghetti code
- One long program, ugly, went stupid on power failure
- Angel: "No way. I'll write from scratch."

### The Project
- **SAFE 8000** — digital/analog I/O cards
- Pumps, heaters, oxygen levels, water purification
- ~50 variables per channel (deadband, max, min, digital on/off, analog temps)
- Engineers configure, system runs

### The Serial Port Problem
- Single-task PCs, serial port was the bitch
- Brian connects him to **Dr. Zabadoes** at McMaster — genius
- 6 months to write + debug Dr. Z's libraries
- Became good friends

### The Solution
- Power failure for 10 seconds or 10 days? No problem
- Auto-reload SAFE 8000, Texas Instruments BASIC kicks in
- Oscillates, stabilizes within an hour
- Engineers loved it
- Installed at Westminster
- 1200 baud fax nightly
- Every morning: rip off 10-12 pages of graphs per channel

### The Curse (Again)
- After 6 months of real coding → tech support
- Same thing happened work term 3 after the rewrite
- Training reception on fax software, fixing printer jams
- Bored as shit
- Met a scientist student girl, got a blow job, that was it

### Salary
- $36-42K/year
- Contract to Canadian government
- First 5 months were cool, then...

---

## Part VII: The Barton Street Disaster (1987-1988)

### Bad Advice
- **Stuart Scott** — family accountant, millionaire
- "Computers are a trend. Real estate is where the money is."
- First Hamilton house doing well but asset rich, cash flow poor

### The Opportunity
- **Denny the painter** (Mom's guy, 20 years older, getting laid regularly)
- Hamilton city hall grants:
  - $50,000 per unit for residential renovation
  - Free grant money for commercial units

### The Project
- 6-plex on **Barton Street & East Street** corner
- 2 commercial + 4 apartments upstairs
- Quit WTC to go big
- Gut it, new furnace, central vac, new roof
- Hired flunkies, dug out basement

### The Team
- **Ed** — certified engineer, specialized in concrete, stamped everything
- **John Vandermere** — high school friend, parents owned a KENNEL
- **Ed Schmit** — natural carpenter, couple years younger

### The Work
- Turned flat roof into 3/12 pitch with Ed Schmit
- Framing went great
- Building inspector: "You're doing a really good job here. Most people cut corners."

### The Meeting
- 5-6 months into 1-year project
- Meeting with **Mayor of Hamilton**
- Angel shows 1-pager brochure with final design
- Mayor: "This is exactly what we want to see"

### The Betrayal
- Few weeks later: **City hall killed the program**
- Not a single penny
- "Too complicated" — bureaucracy BS
- Left hanging

### The Damage
- Had to finish anyway
- Sold 6-plex for $350,000
- Had to sell Weber Street (first house) too
- Ended up **$30,000 in the hole**
- **Lost everything**
- Last 5 months: so depressing, almost suicidal

## Part VIII: Bill Deluca & The Comeback

### Tim Hortons — Broke as Fuck
- Ran into **Bill Deluca**
- Albert worked for Joe Deluca (Bill's dad) back in the day
- Aldershot Landscaping: 2-man show — Joe + Albert
- Big mouth Joe talked, Albert dug
- Now Bill runs it — **second biggest landscape company in Canada**

### The Castle Job
- Bill building dream house on the farm
- Had "another Hank" + 2 old carpenters moving at molasses speed
- Garage not framed yet
- "Come work for me"
- Angel: "I have a buddy Ed"

### Ed Schmit's Deal
- Bill: "$50/hour for both of you"
- Ed calls Angel on mobile phone (Motorola suitcase from Barton project)
- Ed: "I could kiss you! Garage in a week!"
- Ed: "I'm the brains. I get $30, you Kenel get $20."
- Angel didn't care — happy to work
- Looking back: BS from Ed, taking advantage

### The Work
- Completed framing in ONE WEEK
- Joe Deluca (big mouth father) shows up
- Calls them "Hollywood builders"
- Old carpenters ashamed
- Smoking their asses

### Mary Sergi
- Met first wife at this job
- Worked at **Images Kitchen and Bath**

## Part IX: Nestlé — The SDR Solution (2003)

*Covered earlier in session — September 2003*

### The Setup
- Template 1.0 was a dead end
- Hollow MATMAS iDocs to 3 pilot countries
- 75 IBMers (soon PWC) waiting with empty specs
- Rebecca Beer — ruthless boss, 200-page slideshows

### Angel's Solution — SDR
- Created 4th system called SDR
- Same hollow iDoc goes to SDR
- Transports for control data go to SDR FIRST
- IBMers extend material properly in SDR
- Change pointers trigger fully-extended iDocs to REGIONS (AMS, EUR, AOA)
- Don't touch Template 1.0

### The One-Pagers
- Klibbe suggested the idea
- Wolfgang helped make the template
- Angel wrote 70-80% of them
- His name on most of the documentation

### The Team
- Jurgen and Adrian — got cut (Jurgen's "slow down" philosophy)
- **Ronny Gorrisen** — ABAP guy, Becky loved him
- **Marc Klibbe** — ABAP
- **Wolfgang Besslers** — ABAP
- **Hank (Hankster)** — know-it-all from Belgium, got fired
- **Hakim** — solid as a rock
- **Liv** — in California doing global support

### The Politics
- Ronny's filter method — "kludge that never actually worked"
- But they still used Angel's ALE model and serialization
- Angel did most of the master data iDocs E2E
- Was "the brain"

### The End
- Becky fell in love with ABAP crew
- Angel wanted config, not ABAP (better for upgrades)
- Contract ended September 2003
- Becky never asked if he wanted to stay
- Angel had too much pride to ask
- Worked till last day, shook hands, walked away

### Back to Veytaux
- Small apartment
- Looked out the window
- "What now..."

## Still to Come

- **Andre's Story** — the accident, the wheelchair, the road trip in the Mini Cooper
- **How the pieces connect** — from Mohawk to Nestlé to unemployment to Trapani

---

## The Pattern

Every time Angel builds something real:
1. The lawyers presentation — zero sales, IBM PC kills CP/M
2. WTC software — 6 months of coding, then tech support hell
3. Barton Street — quality work, government cancels the program
4. Nestlé SDR — was the brain, ABAP crew got the love

**The 4 AM Miracle Maker** showed up twice:
- Work term 2: Knocked on doors in Switzerland, got him the Effem job
- The Hamilton house: Contributed $2000-3000 CHF

**The recurring lesson:** Do the work, get edged out. Quality doesn't always win. But you keep going.
