# ⭐ **STEP 1 — Your Goals**

### 1️⃣ What do you actually want your life to look like in 18 months?

* ☐ Freelance consulting (small biz, not corporate)
* ☐ Remote-only work
* ☐ Build a product (HelixNet)
* ☐ Make enough to relax, not chase work
* ☐ Work on things that are FUN again
* ☐ Something that gives you purpose
Customers call me i don't want to chase customer for money or work and maybe 2-3 solid projects and a few appreciative customers

# ⭐ **STEP 2 — Your Reality**

### 2️⃣ What’s your estimated financial need?

Juzst so you know 5000 CHF is switzerland is borderline poverty line you need 7000 min and i used to make 15000 in the hay days with Nestle pre-covid . I would be happy with 100000+ bascially what you need to survive and have some spare change for a coffee and gifelie (croissants are not cheap here and the coffee tto -- i say the view in not free in switzerland if you want to sit outside and drink a coffee and biscuit that view you are enjoying cost nearly 10 CHuFs - so i need steady income like solid cash flow -- that is a big problem i have an apartment and it is fine for Sylvie and me and paided off and nice view here in Beckenried but the cost of living is going to kill us and i think we may have to sell everthing and move to Croatia or eastern europe or maybe get a boat and hang out in the greek islands -- i love barefoot weather and not a fan of the cold winter darks days. I have a camper van and that was the ticket when i was working at Nestle Frankfurt and the gigs i did after i could park right on site and sleep work exercise and before RTO was a joke for me i like return to camping in front of the office -- my idea is if you are not having fun then you are doing it wrong -- life has challenges but it should not be a daily grind and that is what it is becoming for many work to pay taxes and survive -- i don't want to survive i want to thrive.  

* ☐ 5k+ CHF/month is absolute min and i would say 10000+ is realistic and nothing greedy in Switzerland (i am not a greedy guy and only want market rates and a fair deal win win for all) -- in romania, 15000,  that is a year of wages but here that is the monthly cost of living for 2 people living i switzerland -sorry what can i say 7500 per person is not a lot of money in sSwitzerland

# ⭐ **STEP 3 — Your Energy & Strengths**

### 3️⃣ What kind of work gives you energy rather than drains you?

ALL listed below i like it all if the people are cool but if you wok with A-Hiles and personal agenda people that will sell their mothers for another step in the ladder than forget it -- teaching eager learners is ok but not much money in that area and the youtubers have that area covered already ( i like Marcel Dempers and Justin from CFE but most of the others 95% are just yappers and go so fast that there is no way to comprehend it or they just talk about code and use power point slide to show their skills off)  
I like all the things youlisted below and anything as long as it has a purpose (i am not a gamer and the only purpose to play video games for me is to observe the software and what they have for new features , it is amazing . i started on a black and white TV playing ping-pong and now we have mine-craft and more -- i thought hosting minecraft servers for the poor Dads and helping out local kids spin them up and let their friends play for free might be a revenue generator but i am not a video guy and helping kids play more games is not exactly helping humanity in a meanful way - i do need to know that what i do actually adds value)
* building systems
* troubleshooting
* teaching
* writing documentation (not so much but doing videos live i like)
* designing architectures
* building tooling
* demos & workshops
* mentoring smart young people
* streaming / explaining things live - ya i like doing this and when it works or we break it and then fix and figure the software out i love that feeling)
* small projects with big impact like the HelixNet code be ....
* working alone -- yes only because nobody wants to work now a days they want to talk to a computer -- vibe code what they don't understand and have AI do it all and that is not how it works -- hard to find anybody that truly thinks and works the way i do -- they talk but come 5pm or showtime they are no where to be found -- i might be over-killing it a little but i like to get my hands dirty and i like my code to be clean so i need to know -- guessing what a system is doing is not my way of trouble shooting issues --  
* working with small teams yes but only if the others are actually working too -- i have been on teams where me and one other heavily paid contractor is working and the others are yapping and not even learning just hiding from the work and bla bla bla -- zero coding skills so they power point they way through all their primetime shows -- and worst yet, the same people use the same slides for months so you get the same story from these people with same slides and same bla bla bla and i don't get it with these people what do they do all day   so yes, sorry, i have a hard time working with others becasue i do the work, they go around telling everybody how great their team is and they act like they know but they don't get into the nitty griity details - so for me most of the time i am litterally begging people to work and do their job like can you generate the cert for A and B so we can start working we have asked for an open firwall port for 3 months and 20+ emaila discussings and yes this is so i can test or at least start the first test , i have seem 6 months waitng for a cert and nothing Deutcshe Borse Luxenbough total joke -- first week i ask well if you want CRM SAP PIPO to talk to the inhouse banking sytem you had for the last 20 years it might be a good idea to test connections and sorry a real system needs security and we should try that asap otherwise developing interface might be a little tough -- anyway the basics are often not understood -- amybe that isthe issue i know from experience if i cannot do it manually it will be very hard to automate. and if we cannot test in dev environment e2e then testing in Production will have similar issues but cost a fortunate do debug and i have no interest in working with people like that but it seems to be the norm becasue develops are working or developing with local host and min integration and have to release untest code.. you k ow me i test and test and test and see what will break and testing 20 containers all at the same time takes time and for example traefik HTTPS MKCERTs seems like a hard thing to learn but what choice do you have learn the mechanics is Production while your reputation goes down the drain waiting for security teams and debugging with Firefighter roles -- this is the norm today -- i have issues with that and i can't live a life with that sort of work standards but i see it over and over -- devs work in small isolated envirnements releasing code that was never tested twice or with HTTPS, how can a developer really say it works in DEV and confidently know it will work in Prod, with Helix net there is no difference dev is the same as Prod maybe optimised differently but the mechnaics better be the same or else i get very confused  - like i say most so called gurus have no idea what it takes to make a real enterprise secure system no clue of he complexities -- they use google as their IDP and are done - log in with google gmail and you are good to go no RBAC no nothing -- every user is the ADMIN great -- i am rabbling agin (i could do a podcast daily and talk to myself for about 4 hours straight of the horrors i have seem the whole IT industry is now in shambles and i kind of seen this coming -- getting a basic https loggin to work is hard really hard to do and wiring up keycloak traefik and fastapi swagger is not a 1 page blog post)  but this is where i get confused what the hell is the world of programming turned into ?? 

Not sure if that helps wit what lights me up but it does spark a never in me and that keeps my lights on while ia watch the industry turn into complete chaos like overnight when covid came around everybody turned into a doctor over night and now AI comes along and LLM can create a to do list for you well what else do you need --  so we need to  aim much higher  the plan toward that.

# ⭐ **STEP 4 — Barriers / Constraints**

### 4️⃣ What are your real constraints?

I have a feeling i am my own worst enemy and should lighten up and relax
don't worry be happy, people are lazy that is good for me 

Well i do have my limits: money and btw Sylvie my wife has zero interest in my work and that is really heart breaking mean while i have to hear about her stuff for hours and i genuinely help her a lot but she is an artist and not keen on computer code not even my emojified terminal screens - so i am really alone and i don't mind i have a friend well kind of Felix is his name no joke i am making the Helix and his name is Felix -- he is actually technically a customer and want me to get a POS setup for his shop and i helped him get the old vending machine working again -- so this is a real thing and there is no pressure -- if figured after the zurich show i would start working on it -- we are aiming for Jan 1st POS in the shop like after Christmas and what he wants is yero integration just print the totals and he write the 4 numbers down -- he does not care what he sells just how much visa, cash etc -- that what he says but i know what he needs and really wants but like i said i wanted to finsh HelixNet for the Zurich show and then Felix and his shop POS -- he has 2 employees that work part-time at Artemis Luzern -- maybe you know of the store -- i am a smoker and met him one day there 2 years ago and we became friends and he wants me to do his POS -- 

My limits are 
* ☐ No GPUs
* ☐ Laptop limits but i Felix gave me 2 old XP machines and I saif I would put debian on them -- so we have CPUs maybe 
* ☐ Swiss-German language barrier - this goes beyond words
* ☐ Age bias -- is real but i can compete with the anybody who wants to talk shop even 5 year olds or 8 year olds 
* ☐ Need for flexible schedule -- i have nothing to do so i am very flexible
* ☐ You don’t want large corporate drama - i don't want to be involved in it becasue it is a joke typically so watching on the side lines is fun 
* ☐ Don’t want SAP anymore - - this sparks a never - actually i hate what SAP are doing to their customer -- basically nothing is backward compatible either you are in the SAP walled garden or you are out. The SAP BTP solution is a lot of bloat and drama and over-complicated by design -- SAP does it that way to keep their paid consultant swimming and dancing in the meeting rooms with " if you can't baffle them with brilliance - baffle them with bullshit" -- for SAP  BTP they want to use for customising the SAP final Coad soltuion - so no more customitations for the cloud user-- then SAP says ,, we want clean core and if you want customisation's use the BTP to customize -- good luck with that plan and they are really telling customers to customize with BTP -- we could customize with HelixNet about 500x faster and millions cheaper too and maybe a few smiles along the way too but i will not make it there to those CIO offices because the CIOs and CTOs today are young, no programming skills and actually believe or i guess they believe the nonsense in the white papers written by people who can not program themselves out of a paper bag or most likely, and i am sure have never write a simple line of code and now these are the same people telling us the future of ROI work (meeting coffee break distraction drama personal agenda etc)  and AI will save the world and do everybodies work seamlessly and on top of that promoting Vibe coding as a real soltion for these clueless people (you can see where this is going sprially around the drain) and don't look at the code concept or understand why the error occurs just ask AI to fix it and voila a working bobust program that make 50000 per month and it only took an hour to build with absolutely no programming skills   -- where the hell are we going -- i am here trying to move forward and the rest of the world saying relax AI will do it all (LLMs have there limits and laptops too and from what i hear GPUs are in short supply) -- they are so clueless and so naive -- this is why i am alone -- you and I know but 99% of the so-called gurus are fakes . i am not here tooting my own horn but i see so many bullshitters and that is one thing i never ever do is lie. I don't know how to do it and if i always try to tell the truth at least i don't have to apologise when i fail, and i fail fast and often -

* ☐ Want to work from home - yes 100% if possible

You can add anything else I should know Sherlock too -- i ramble a lot and really i am just an ideas guy -- i have ideas but to bring them to life sia nother story -- actually i had the idea that use the AO LLM for kids -- the steam punk flying submarines and have kids talk to LLM to generate a 2D picture and my system takes the 2D and makes a wire diagram 3D and desplays that via stable diffusion or blender or whatever and the kids say ya that's the model i just designed - print via a remote 3d printing service -- the box comes back to him a week later with all the parts and he can assemble it -- when i was a kid we had models and glue and made lego and meccani stuff .. so that was my original businees idea like 3D printing with 3D printing that would be out sourced like they do for the mugs and t-Shirts.

Then i had the other idea that came up in July a few months agoi and i went down that rabbit hole and ended up with helixNet -- the idea was take 4-5 inputs j2, json, context yaml and process batch job style request to LLM that is what HelicNet is built and design for send a cURL type payload get a quick 201 or 200 response and sooner or later get an email with your results linked to the dashboard every logged  in helixNet user would have-- and hen just a platform that anyone could start building with like a django-cookie-cutter -- was even thing making this project into a cookie cutter but not today maybe next week after the show and if there is any interest in HelixNet.  I like the helix net and the service i have there -- what do you think do you like it too Sherlock -- it's not SAP BTP shiny but she (helix Net is a she i think)  is a little beast and generally healthy most of the time and with LLM looking at logs and trouble shooting in the background that gets me really excited and would rather to that then type out all this to tell you the truth -- i don't care enough about money i like to have fun.

# ⭐ **STEP 5 — Passions & Vision**

### 5️⃣ What’s the big vision behind HelixNet?


The full vision is hard because the helixNet is really just a solid platform for anybody that want to start building a real app. for example you need a DB always and POstgres 17.6 is supper stable, MinIO for obect storage to work together with Postgres and nothing better than Postgres and MinIO so we have that area covered and then redis rabbitMQ qdrant and those extra a just feature add-ons and just work no issues with those service ever they are solid .. then you have Keycloak and the relam of fire and traefik and MKCERT for clean URLS and RBAC, then we have FastAPi Async services based (not the light REST API request and response with 5K or less payloads limits ) which is python that anybody can start learning and easier than JS but you need JS and HTML skills too - so we have that backend frontend stuff always in the mix -- personally i love cURL and Daniel the owner of cURL is a cool guy that has a cool product (he works hard too) there and very much mis-understood -- the webhook URL waiting for a payload is so powerful  and I have no problem working the back-end and just swagger UI - i like it and it is so base and says it all ( i am starting to actually enjoy working with VSCode tto but it took a while to get the hang of things and still lots to learn there but i must say for an IDE it is way better than Eclipse or any workbenches i have seen and is actually better than the MS Visual Studio, Eclipse , SAP workbench etc -- VS Studio might look better but is the wrong tool for the job -- took me time to learn that the hard lessons. Anyway, the so called gurus can work the front-end but i take charge in the back end wiring the real work in my opinion. what else LLM tooling is another major area that needs continuous learning but not from the you-tubers but real people but not on the ML and training new models but using models that exist and leveraging what is already there and free now (GPT CHAT btw will be free to the work as a service from MS next year IMHO and most models will be free the servers behind them will cost money but the model is just software so you should figure it is really free if you can download it and use it - it's free to use -- i think licensing software is a great idea but you need to have a free version and ideally a unlimited free limited version for free and that goes for SAP but they are too greedy -- i want freedom for the world and myself and today they want to restrict freedom of speech and movement and Digital IDs and i can see the UBI vapor money coming soon with crypto digital money for everyone - not good but they are pushing it in Europe and will lock down society with digital currencies  ) --

Back on track I want :
* “A system kids can learn from.”
* “A full LLM stack anyone can run.”
* “A teaching tool.”
* “A personal laboratory.”
* “A business accelerator.”
* “A developer productivity suite.”
* “A tiny BTP competitor.” >>> that would be ideal and was a big motivation the HelixNet <<< 
* “Something beautiful and fun.” and poetic in away the helixNet was also a story telling machine like Syn Field concept that was a big one we would input yml with sory line chapters character etc, we have some content txt file and j2 template the json output for table of chapters and the whole book would come out in json ready for prost processing -- that is actually the real goal but helixNet can also map CSV files and integrate with N8N for example so lots of flexibility wit HelixNet -- it was build to be flexible and adaptable so developers could hit the ground running and not have to wire up 20 service before starting to code a line or 2 of there application -- the infra is helixNet and they build on top of it and with it and add what they like -- they can not remove too much of the helixNet but once they have it running it would be their platform of choice to build on and develop real end to enterprise apps -- that was my idea a little gift to the world and give them some direction bot another you tube video and bla bla bla but a real working tool and platform they can be confident the programs are not going to be a thrown away  like a demo app or a dead-end solution. Ok Sherlock does that help and can we summarise and double check we are on the same page now  and continue with your plan for me ?
