Hi and welcome welcome welcome this is Zish visionary life hacks here to
connect here to inspire and here to be the change let me just let me just like
that okay so welcome welcome happy Saturday what are we on Saturday the 7th of
February 2026 so this is Zish chiming in visionary life hacks and today I'm
going to be sharing I haven't done a life for a bit and just had loads of work
commitments and this and the other so I've just not had the time or the
the inclination to do a life but I've had loads of questions coming in in
different groups like the TZLA groups not today for example I had a question
you claim that argon gas no you claim that the tubes are XYZ no they're not
they're argon gas and I'm like like where have you got this information from
so for example you can ask me Zish where do you get your information from so I
get my information from and I think this is really really important get my
information directly from the original literature from 1919 1910 1911 mainly
like most of all this information that I'm gleaning is from the school of high
frequency that was based out of Chicago in 1910 by Dr. Eberhardt and you can
find this also I might even compile a booklet where people can access this you
can also go to archive.org and the electro-therapy museum Mr. Jeff Bahay it's
a Ukrainian name lovely guy with an electro-therapy museum out of Fort Lauderdale
and and so I get a lot of information from him now a lot of people think there
are noble gases like argon in the original antique tubes and if we look at
Jeff Barrick's TZLA for some strange reason he's using mercury tubes when he
could be using neon tubes so they did use some noble gases and I've said this in
many of my previous presentations that they did use some noble gases like neon
and radium and in some instances mercury but if we want to really get into the
crux of this the original story was that Westinghouse and Edison were
having a little battle of like who could create the first light bulb and in
amongst this before you had the Tesla high-frequency violet rays or any of the
high-frequency technology that came out of it Tesla did an experiment where
he actually healed a lady's cancer using a an x-ray tube using an x-ray tube
which is like this big bald tube and he used it with high-frequency and he
healed the lady's cancer and it made it into all the publications but
actually he realized when he then went further into this it was the high
frequency that actually healed the lady's cancer it just so happened that he
was using an x-ray tube because back then they were using x-ray they things
weren't weaponized and they were really under the oath of do no harm and they
were really looking to provide solutions because they were in a Renaissance in
an age of the golden age of electricity at that point around the
1800s 1800s 1900s so they were going from electrostatic devices large
diothermic devices and then they went to the high-frequency violet rays and
and between the violet ray they were going from these diothermic high-frequency
devices with the true spark gaps with the rare earth minerals where they were
using the glass tubes now people for some strange reason think that the
violet and I understand why they might think that the violet in the tube is a
noble gas but it isn't a noble gas it was they were they were blowing the glass
and when you blow the glass you get I'm not an expert on blowing glass but you
would get a specific atmosphere inside the glass tube which was the raw
ether the raw you know you can think of it from Reich's perspective life force
life energy organ on whatever you want to call it but for all intents and
purposes let's call it you might want to call it plasma but for all intents and
purposes let's call it raw ether raw energy and when you then create the vacuum
and you choose a specific atmosphere you get a different color so you could have
a red color you could have a blue color you could have an orange color you could
have any color you wanted for some reason they chose a thousandths of an
atmosphere and that color that was the emanation of that thousands of an
atmosphere in the vacuum tube is the color violet it is the color violet which
is in which would be in the tubes they would have blown it in the tubes and then
there were specific tubes before they actually created the metal to go into the
wand before they create the metal to go into the wand and I might as well show
you I might as well show you this is not there is no noble gas in these tubes they
would use sometimes neon and sometimes radium but that was in rare instances most
of the tubes of violet most of the tubes of violet
you see what it does it actually primary it actually switched when I was using
the machine it switched the machine over to another app so analog technology is
so disruptive so the other day then someone asked me some other questions like
about healing like what healing do they do now so for me personally people like
Jeff and that they're in their private groups and they've they've got these
private places where they where they make the claims that they make now me
personally I go into the banner of what the literature was saying back in the
1900s 1900s and I personally and this has been coming up loads they genuinely
don't make things to the standard that they used to they don't make things
of this machine that I was just firing up that's for sale is over a hundred
and twenty five years strong it's this particular machine is one thousand six
hundred pounds sterling two thousand two hundred dollars and it's an amazing
machine it comes with one two three four five six comes with six seven eight
ten electrodes are throwing some extra electrodes they don't build things
like they used to you go and buy a modern technology today and then we can
talk about the modern technologies is like loads of fake rife machines they
shouldn't really be called rife machines because they're only using the
audio the true rife technology is using radio and audio and it doesn't
reduce you to a diagnosis and I always say this is like how an earth do you
know what you are so you've been given the diagnosis that you're a Lyme's
disease well first things first who gave you that diagnosis how were they
trained and how long have they been in that in that that idea of what they are
are they the greatest physician they ever were because back in the original
literature the physician aka doctor the chiropractor and the naturopath were
all under equal standing and they all incorporated ether now today you can go
and ask somebody what is high zero you can go and ask someone today what is
water you can go and ask someone today what is magnetism and like anybody that
claims to know what magnetism is like someone like Kenneth Wheeler I don't
understand the word of what they're saying but when I went on this journey to
learn how to build anti nanotechnology I had to ask myself the question what is
magnetism and I was really blessed to find on the YouTube so Eric Braithwaite
who is making thank you he was making gyroscopic railways he was making gyroscopic
railways and the first thing he said was we don't know what magnetism is which
then allowed me to be coachable to think wow this is a professor he doesn't
know what magnetism is I'm in good company now if you listen to Sir Alan
Savry he was an amazing he's an amazing regenerative agriculturalist
farmer he lives in the desert and he does this amazing thing called what is
science and he's like really clear that most science today is regurgitated
useful humans that are reading white papers and they're just memorizing it
regurgitating it and they're not really in any state of a renaissance so you're
getting a diagnosis often from a compartmentalized human that has learnt
compartmentalized science probably from early chat GBT or the people that only
want you to know what they want you to know because they have vested interests
under the banner of the pharmaceutical industry it's just the way that it is
and the pharmaceutical industry is not like what the pharmaceutical industry was
back in the days of the 1900s nor is the food nor is the technology and
certainly not the medicine you know they've made cannabis illegal and then
they gave it back to you in strange super hybrid skunk formulations it's no
longer what cannabis was you'd be lucky to find Lebanese cannabis today pure
Moroccan cannabis today pure British cannabis today it's all been so altered
it's genetically modified and it's far removed from what God created and you
can you can find the same as that in Coca-Cola Coca-Cola isn't what Coca-Cola
was Coca-Cola once was just Coca and cola you know and maybe really pure water
but you know what is it today there's probably mostly sugar most fully phosphoric acid
and then you've got all these other strange things they're far removed most essential oils
that are adulterated there's I literally know three companies where I can get four companies
maybe five companies where I can get really pure therapeutic grade essential oils most supplements
are contaminated there's only a few companies where I know I can get a decent toothpaste
get decent supplementation I haven't seen someone yesterday that I respected talking about
magnesium I looked at the ingredients and I thought oh my god I wouldn't put that into my body
and I actually respect him so it's really really really difficult and you go to the technology
you've got this Jeff Barrett TZLA he's like honking the trumpet that his is the best thing
since sliced bread and you're like you've got to upkeep the spark gaps and you've got stupid stupid
people going this is all gone gas and you know Jeff is doing this and I like well yeah Jeff might
be doing that EE system might be doing that spooky system might be doing that and all these
different things might be doing that but nobody's ever putting in the big elephant in the room
which is the geoengineering the mRNA gene editing technology that's been unleashed onto people the
spike protein nobody's thinking about the internet of everything the internet of nano things the
internet you know the digital twin the Sabrina Wallace all that blackpill stuff nobody's thinking
about those things people are relentlessly taking things like zealots and chlorella, full
vick minerals, chillerjit, c60 nanosilver, diatomaceous earth like the stupidity activated charcoal
people aren't thinking they're listening to the next goofy guru and what Zeisha's doing is
keeping it simple stupid in this so called smart world and so what can you actually do and that's
why I like this antique analogue tesla technology and sure I have a bias towards it because I use it
but if Jeff's technology, if the EE system, if the syrupy, the syrupy is another one this syrupy
and the pyre, this pyre and syrupy it's got argon gas in it or it's got some sort of noble gases
in it it's got might have some neon in it and it's got mercury in it and I'm like why are you
putting all these things in it and then they use these buzz words like negan, trafi and all these
kind of buzz words to kind of like you know wrap it up in esoteric jargon so they become these
these authorities and then you go and see who they're colluding with and they're colluding with
spooky data harvesting Chinese technology that is made with modern electronics and I'm like
and which is promoting zealots and nylon clothing it doesn't stop with just the technology
it doesn't stop with just the technology if somebody's like sharing with me a technology and they're
wearing glasses if someone's sharing a technology and they're wearing a night clothing if someone's
sharing a technology with me and they're promoting some ramp the cult you know EDTA human being that
is hormones are all whack why am I going to listen to them why am I going to listen to them so you
know you've you've always got to look at the variables and it's really good to look at things
holistically and to discern and like when someone's coming in like spouting you know you claim
that XYZ when it's argon I'm like what where are you getting this information from I know where
I'm getting my information from the original literature from the 1800s and the 1900s and it's
all there with folks that have a vision to see with eyes that can see and so for me I don't stop
at the analog high frequency tesla devices I'm invested in the true rife technology I'm invested
in the true unbalanced multi wave oscillators I'm invested in the learning of what like I only
learnt about the atmosphere I already knew that it was just pure raw ether but I didn't know the how
I didn't know about the atmosphere I didn't and then and it's only because people are coming
to me with all these questions like well zesh Jeff claims that his machine goes for hours and I'm
like yeah well that's going to overstimulate you because the true technology it has the side
effect of a positive side effect of actually emitting ozone it actually emits ozone so it sterilizes
it was used by the French military they had colleges in Chicago in Holland in Germany the Germans
were writing volumes about high frequency inspired by the school of thought coming out of Chicago
Chicago and Detroit with a with a home of this school of thought and the Germans were then
running with it the Italians were running with it the the the Czechoslovakians were running with it
the British were running with it they all and their machines are quite crude but they were running
with it and so everybody was like you know you could have gone to your barbers they were working with
this so you get so if I talk about that you get the you get the benefits of the electricity you get
the benefits of the fact that they were based on truth and that they were building things to last
like this is 125 years strong you know it's made with bacola plastic some of them have got
wood some of them have got marble they got rare earth minerals they've got iron core they've got
they've got wrapped coils of copper around them there's no modern electronics other than the fact
that we replace the capacitor today with a modern capacitor and then you've also got a fact into
the electricity and what's going on with the electricity grid and the electricity grid is full of
like dirty harmonics so then like if you're using modern electronics and these people are claiming
to be kind of libertarian Bitcoin you know capitalists and all this kind you know Bitcoin
you know anarchists Bitcoin libertarians and then they're selling you machines that you know
that they're not you know are they made in Mexico was the capacitor made in Mexico was it all made
in Mexico like at least when you get a Detroit machine it was all made in a little shop in Detroit
it was made in a little shop in New York it was made in a little shop in Chicago it was made in a
little shop in Leipzig or in Holland you know these the this was a real kind of like a cottage
cottage industry and I often say you know back then the food was real the medicines were real
that they were dialing into the pure raw thought of the ether everything was much more pureer
wasn't it because they were the ether there was no geoengineering as we know it today
so everything about when they were building these things and so if you were to build one you would
reverse engineer it exactly the same as the way that it was given to you you wouldn't then go
in and put a mercury bulb the cognitive dissonance is ridiculous like you know you're not a frequency
you're not a Lyme's disease frequency you're not a 432 Hertz frequency that's all ridiculous
like every you don't go out in nature and you only hear one frequency when you go out in nature
you've got the little birds singing you've got the you've got the little dogs barking you've got
you've got you know the airplanes rumbling over you you've got the rustling of the trees you've
got the sounds of the owls the sounds of the eagles you know you've got the sounds of nature and there's
a multitude of frequencies it's not just one frequency there's a multi and then you've got the
human resonance of the earth so everything's like a multitude of frequencies and then there's you
which is a combination of loads of cells and the machines the true machines meet the human
where the humans to the true rife technology does this the true tesla technology does this
the true multi wave oscillator does this it meets the human where the humans who so it's actually
pure unconditional technology that's what it is you don't have to like reduce yourself to a diagnosis
so you get the sterilization thank you you get the sterilization of the ozone you get the electrons
the photons the raw ether which is like the energy and you're getting something that was built with
dignity and and and built to last and that's worlds apart and it's actually priced true it's not like
you know like someone like Jeff's machine only costs about maybe now for the tariffs and that
about fifteen hundred dollars if you wanted to build one but I have no inclination to want to
build one because I'm like well why would I want to build that when I've got the original antique
technology here that is does what it says on the packet it's got the pure raw ether in it known
like if anyone has if you go to a shop today and they claiming to sell the real MWA and on their
website they're selling argon gas well I won't even go any further into it it's like if I go and
find a supplement and I see they're putting silica into it I find a company and I see they're
putting silica into it I find a company and they're putting something that I know you know for
example the other day they were going uh doctor David Wolff's coming to Britain I'm looking at this
doctor David Wolff and he looks like some sort of like sort of rock star Hollywood doctor
you know claims he's a doctor I don't even know if he is a doctor he's coming to and it doesn't
even matter if he is but he's claiming to be some sort of doctor he's coming to Britain some British
websites um organising him and I'm looking at all the products like first minute I'm looking at
all the products that they're selling they're selling shillers here they're selling they're selling
loads of products and I'm like what what are these people like who why are they inviting this man
who what is this man going to be talking about if they're website of all the junk that they're
selling is any clue and everybody believes it's good you even see this there was this other woman
this um this Catherine Edwards she was there talking hi Fiona she was talking this Catherine
Edwards and she was talking with these so-called nano whistleblowers that are promoting master
peace zealot and she's there with her MLM zealites selling her zealites and she was like
Zish and I want to get on a call with you and I'm like yeah but you sell zealites why am I going to
get a call on a call with you I know all about nano I know because they've all heard about
Sabrina Wallace and then suddenly they're all experts on nano and nobody's an expert on nano
but fortunate for me I've I met a nano scientist and I said to him well look we're using chlorides
we're using acid so we're using things like epsom salt borax trisodium phosphate
and you might want to take notes borax sodium bicarbonate epsom salt trisodium phosphate um we're
using uh what else we're using uh white wine vinegar hydrogen peroxide and essential oils you know
what do you think of that with my anti nano triangle and he was like yeah that actually sounds
really good because he's making it through the tesla for recess you can and the optogenetics
or whatever it's called the light frequencies that's why you want to stay away from terror hurts
frequencies you want to stay away from the blue light reduce the blue light and bring in more
of the red light and all those different you know and the green lights you look at the electrodes
that they were using yes they were pure atmosphere of violet but sometimes they were using specific
colors they were actually using colored glass they'd use blue glass they'd use green glass
they'd use yellow glass they'd use white glass but they weren't using funky gases like argon
that's a siop that's modern that's not what was in the original glass the original glass
is pure royal ether which you could call energy and it's because of the way that they were
blowing the glass as specific thousands of an atmosphere and you might go well zish where did you
where did you come up with that did you read it from some so-called expert that suddenly appeared
and claims to think that it's arg I've seen it and I seen on a website somewhere they were claiming
it was argon gas and I was like where did they get that information from when if you read the original
1910 documentation that you can get from archive.org from the electro therapy museum of the high
frequency manual which I own a copy of it here somewhere where is it where is it where are you
where are you my high frequency manual you hear it's not here is it here I've got it somewhere
it's usually here but I haven't got it here to hand I've got it here to hand oh it's all here I
just tied it up so I can't I can't find it right now but in the in the original 1910 manual
from you can watch one of my videos where I talk I read chapter one yeah I think it's in chapter
two of the high frequency manual from 1910 1911 by doctor Eberhart of the school of high frequency
in Chicago and they had thousands of homeopathic schools as well in Chicago in all over America
before world war one I think it was the martial plan or the flex in a report or something where they
during world war two suddenly all the food we were put into rations they brought in margarine
farming started to happen the NHS was created and things went to pot and I'm not talking about
pure cannabis I'm talking about like you know adulterated food you know adulterated medicine
and adulteration of our schooling education everything you know the last 220 years
style you know the propaganda machine for the newspaper the radio and now the modern
style is the digital the new age and the combined digital and the steering at the new age
and this so-called truth movement it's like like what what is this what is this ridiculous truth
movement you are either had ears to hear like I remember when I was like 16 and we were learning
you know the emotional plague and Wilhelm Reich and and the function of the orgasm and cloud
busting and we knew about the heart back then and we're learning about borax and you know maybe
it was a bit of a style maybe the rave culture was a style I don't know maybe it was maybe it was
all hijacked but it was still good before it was weaponized you know stone henge you know with the
wallies back in the 70s you know and the Megan Fears that would have been good but sure they got
co-opted things got changed and altered and I think there's been a war on the west and the war on
you know anything free you know people coming together to gather people coming together to have
real authentic community now the word community anytime you hear the word community it's usually
wrapped up in some kind of agenda so you've got to be really discerning with what you do and nobody's
going to save you the only human is going to save you is you and I'm really much more of a
protagonist in empowering and educating the human being that they can take the ball by the horns
and and you can start to go to Western A price foundation and start to support the you know learn
to make your own fermented foods learn to make your own sourdough get control of your water don't
wait for these black swan events don't wait wait for the next world you man build those relationships
today build those connections today with the man that makes the best butter the lady that loves her
cow and makes amazing a to dairy yeah sure we're being due engineered but you can put God wins
this battle whatever God is and knowing that there's a higher power over government and supporting
that which is the greatest expression of itself was it what they call it and spirit is always
seeking greater fuller expression and expansion and everything in nature that was created in nature
and I always say to people you're looking at supplement looking at an original 1900s family
physician you know yes this charcoal in there there's no such thing as activated charcoal the
only way you activate charcoes by having a fire and you do a pp on the after the fires happened
and then you have activated charcoal or if you have a friend that is somebody that is harvesting
hazel they're making charcoal the byproduct of that is going to be biochar and the best way to
activate it is by pping on it but this whole idea of activated charcoal that again it's part of
the problem yeah you're looking the original family physician you're going to find borax you're
going to find bone beef broth stew you're going to find epsom salts you're going to find mer you're
going to find frankincense you're going to find lemongrass you're going to find time you're
going to find cannabis you're going to find opium you're going to find electotherapy
magnetic homeopathy chiropractor naturopath physician do no harm you know so so for me I really
I don't know why but I just like to keep it simple stupid no zealites no aluminium silica no
diatomaceous earth no c60 no either mectin like the either mectin thing just my mind boggles like
that shows me that somebody hasn't even looked into soil making their own compost growing your
own food the quality of the seed what kind of root stock is it what kind of apple is it not all
apples are created equal what is GMO what is novel foods and then to combine it and to add insult
to injury look at all these fake rife technologies fake technologies and because someone's coming
over as I'm you know I'm a bit coin you know what you have no bit coins plummeting you know
Epstein coin you know you start to realise it's all a sign up and so you know and so really
getting into the real true technology the one thing that it's done for me is it's opened up
the ideas and a wise man said it beautifully the illiterate of the 21st century will not be those
that cannot read and write but will be those that cannot unlearn relearn and learn again and I'm
not the smartest man in the room but I do choose to associate myself with folks that I can hear
because they've had experiences as elders were they gone off into the wilds of San Francisco
eaten loads of wild food walked miles to go and listen to some bark in a an original cathedral
where they're playing the organ music and they're getting the down loads because their blood plasma
is dialed into nature you know they're working with the plasma tubes they're experiencing green
piece coming in and smashing up all this amazing technology components made in America so do
not think then if I'm listening to someone like that it's a tesla genius or a will ham right
genius I might pick something up and be able to pass that on to you that's why I'm into what I'm
into because I'm like wow look and I want to support that I want to support that research of the
earth transmitter you know hearing the sound of the earth what's going on with the earth's
resonance you know no siops very conservative looking at it through an engineering lens no new age
BS just really like looking into what is this counter space and doing experiments with you know when
you hear these people making the claims like walk away Jon Snow because like I can't even say to
you that frankincense heals cancer can I when I know that it does but I'm not allowed to say that
because of like what's out there in the world today and even by saying that I'm like well you
know there is evidence that it has the benefits of supporting what is cancer what really is it
and how does frankincense interact with cancer and is it is it a good thing or a bad thing
and I think if we're not looking at things through that lens and doing the experiments okay I've
got a garden here if I grow this garden here with with a horse manure that has either meched in it
and strange chemicals in it and I have a garden right next to it and in this garden I've got
earthworms I've got charcoal biochar I've got horse manure from happy horses and hemp bedding
in there and earthworms that are dancing what is going to happen with this garden with the
ivory meched in and the GMOs and the round up and what's going to happen with this and only if I
do that experiment with the two will I know what will happen now we've done experiments like we're
being well okay Lime's disease doesn't exist viruses don't exist where being poisoned what am I
able to do to tackle this oh can I use a hold a clock zapper oh no I can't because when I use a
hold a clock zapper the nanosynthetic particles are utilizing the frequencies from the zapper and
they're using them to self assemble right so now we know that no zappers right can we use the
terahertz frequency one well one tick it's analog two oh no it's terahertz they use terahertz
to make self assembling nanoparticles I don't think we should use the terahertz ones put that back
but it heals each well yeah for sure I could eat a vegan diet living in Hawaii for a bit I might
have been eating junk food and for the first time ever I'm having what you would call a healing
response when what I'm really experiencing is experiencing is something that's alive that my
body can recognize it's utilizing it and for the first time I feel alive I'm having a healing
yes it doesn't mean that you're supposed to then live off coconuts for the rest of your life
but you now know that when you have a young fresh green coconut drone in the wilds of the volcanic
zealite rich ocean you know and you eat the nony fruit off the land as a first expression of
the volcano they made you feel good it doesn't mean that you're just going to go and eat
only for the rest of your life although you could do a mono diet if you chose to live in Hawaii
but then you might also want to explore the fact that wow if that happened to me with a nony
if that happened to me with a coconut well grandmother used to feed me okra grandmother used to
feed me cilantro grandmother used to feed me bone broth grandmother used to feed me buttermilk dairy
grandmother used to feed me cardamom cinnamon clove rose in honey um organ meats maybe I should
now look at these things but I'm now not going to go to the supermarket because what's super about
it they sell all these they tell us that the planet's dying they tell us that this climate change
happening but yet when I go into the supermarket or my local spa shop everything in those shops
is surely adding to the fact that this problem's happening in our planet today with poisonings
and you know end up trying disrupting things and maybe these things in these supermarkets that are
owned by these big corporations that are telling us why we are the problem and why everything
is the problem and where the reason for that problem yet they're making millions and billions
and trillions you know even your amazons and your what-knots they're making billions and trillions
and gazillions selling you products that are actually contributing to the problems that we're
having in this world today whereas when you think well ok well actually I actually want to be a
green person I actually want to contribute towards making the world a better place maybe I should
start to grow my own food maybe I should stop washing my clothes with that washing up powder
that is making the frogs turn gay you know messing up the messing up the ecosystem well now you
start to have your own compost lieu you start to become a bit conscious about what you're putting in
your food you start to become conscious about what you're cleaning your teeth with you start to be
conscious about the food that you're giving to your beloved pets you think well ok well maybe
this dog food isn't really dog food and maybe this kibble isn't really kibble and I shouldn't give
it to my cats I shouldn't give it to my dogs this doesn't look very good I've just read some
Juliet de Barrakelevi that was commissioned by the late King George to go and live with the gypsies
around the world why is it that all the animals that live with the gypsies are so resilient for being
very conscious about that word if they throw those words at you use those words live by those words
you are then the agenda you are then the agenda you become the agenda 2030 ok they're spouting
resilience I'm going to become resilience they're spouting climate change I'm going to become
a carbon bank I'm going to build a carbon footprint I'm going to grow my own food I'm going to
wear conscious clothing that is supportive of my skin allowing it to breathe I'm going to get
out into the sun I'm going to get my vitamin D I'm going to eat my medicinal mushrooms I'm going
to grow my own medicinal mushrooms I'm going to you know support a local lady that's loving her
ducks and her chickens and allowing her ducks and chickens to express their most amazing ducking duck
duck and chicken this I'm going to support the man that loves his cows I'm going to go and research
the Western A price foundation I'm going to see what I'm going to learn about sodium bicarbonate I'm
going to learn about epsom salt so I'm going to learn about borax so I'm going to read that
nexus magazine article I'm going to learn about the benefits of bay leaf and some of the studies
that have been done on brain you know I've been holding back for so long because I can't say the
word cancer I can't say the word parasite I'm like one minute why can't I say the word parasite
why can't I say the word cancer there is a truth about cancer cancer has killed people that you
loved and why is it killed the people that you love because of all those rubbish food stores
that are local and they shouldn't be there and they are part of the problem they're part of
the problem they're the reason your granny got cancer that's the stuff that they put in there
and it's wrong they experiment on you they it's the treatments that they give to you that have
come from world war one world war two and they're the things that kill you when this the answers are
the keys are simple and it should no longer be about vested interests and conflicts of interests
in how much money they can make because that's bs it's it's all about empowering you educating you
that you can if I can do this you can do this and I'm not perfect and I'm not the smartest man
in the room and if I can do it I'm just a little tiny kid from Newport Gwent you know that went
to the same school schooling as you you know wasn't encouraged to ask great questions wasn't taught
logic you know just all of it a complete shit show and I had a very terrible vaccine experience
age 10 and at that point I was done with the system it was broken schooling's broken medicine
NHS has broken all these idiot people reform labor all these shit parties the only good party is
the monster raving loony party and that doesn't even exist anymore and the only true good parties
they're no gone they've been weaponized they've been destroyed anything good they destroy they
taint it they try and buy it they co-opt it they turn it into kerontel probe and it becomes an
arrested development rubbish leading people nowhere and the key to it is to empower yourself
learn something new and keep that brain youthful by learning something new you could start with
learning about des rosier essential oils and their oil called mer des rosier essential oils just
start with that just learn about des rosier essential oils it's a great place to start learn about
just learn something new that is the key learn something new and surrender to courage and
putting your best foot forward and being the greatest version of yourself that you can if you're
second tired of the food that you're eating you know find them most local like I drive an hour
once a week to go to an organic farm shop where they're growing all their own food and they got
mountains of wood chip and they make their own compost he's been there for about 10 years and he
feeds the whole area so I can convert that energy money into supporting a gentleman he's a bit
of a socialist you know I agree with some of his things but they were wearing the masks and all
that but he grows really good vegetables I don't have to agree with everything that he does but
he grows good vegetables so I give him my money I've chosen to strategically vote with my dollars
vote with my pounds I'm voting with my pounds I'm giving them the money to those that I want to
see in the world but then I'm also investing in the seed I'm investing in investing in growing
our own food building soil fertility and then if they're geoengineering I'm asking myself well
what can I do if they're geoengineering and how can I help reduce that poison anyway I've said
enough I've said enough that was a little bit of a rant in there because I have actually been
holding back and it's like well why can't I say that something does XYZ you should be able to
say it but maybe you can't and maybe I shouldn't but I said it anyway because it's it's it's important
that people know these things it's broken schools broken the NHS is broken you can't say that
it doesn't even make a difference if someone now goes into a school and start like I was talking
to a lady the other day a few years ago and she said they've even now removed I was a kid and they
removed milk from school well they've now removed bone broth from school so the school is actually
broken you can't the anyway you fix the school is by becoming the school madden mantis
Montessori said it good she said children have everything they need within them you've just
got to create an environment where they can allow themselves to express themselves without
turning them into brainwashed idiots that are just regurgitating the same thing is the last year
and the last year and the last year no she didn't say that madden Montessori was much more
eloquent in her speech but she said children have everything they need within them you just have
to create a good space where they're allowed to thrive it's like you put soil if you put night
shade in the ground and water it or if you put hopey corn in the ground and water it and you
put equal attention to both of them they're both going to grow but if I go well I'll have some
night shades I want some potato so I'm going to put all my focus on those night shades and I'm going
to create good soil I'm going to choose a good potato I'm going to put it into good soil I'm going
to nourish it look after it feed it create an optimum environment for that potato to grow and maybe
some of them will grow maybe some of them won't grow but at least I put my my mind into it my heart
into it really thought about it put my imagination into it to grow a good potato you know and then
you might get a potato and you can do the same with the corn you can do but if I just focus on
doing nothing and allowing the and allowing the weeds whatever the weeds are to grow well the first
thing you would get from that was you'd get a calling card of the condition of your soil you know
like for example we've got a lot of butter cups and the butter cups are obviously doing
something but we can't really do much with the butter cup I think it's golden rod we can't do
much with it I think it has some sort of medicinal qualities but what we're choosing to do then is
we're using all the cardboard that we have left over we're laying it on the ground then we're putting
down compost then we're putting down seaweed then we're going to put down manures then we're
going to put down our own homemade compost and then we're going to put a specific seed that we've
learned about that we know is good and we're going to then put that into the soil and we're going
to do our very best to create an optimum environment knowing that we're being due engineered but still
focusing on the fact that we need food that we want food and that we're going to have food and then
we're doing that with garlic we're doing that with onions potatoes herbs when our children's
birthdays are happening they're asking us for trees then you know Kate mum will be with our daughter
and they'll be there for days like deciding what peach tree they want what mulberry tree they want
what apple tree they want what root stops are going to be on can it grow on this mountain
and they're really thinking into it learning something new about the apple tree learning something
new about the garden and from the first year they've learned something new the second year they've
learned what worked what didn't work and each time they're applying those different things and what
they learned what didn't work discarding that okay we grew that there it didn't work okay let's
let's try again and just continuously trying and putting your best foot forward to try and make
something better happen and that's called solution based but if you're just there talking about
the solutions and never making any never doing anything going well I have to work I have to do this
I have to do that creating all these reasons why you can't do it oh it costs a little bit too much
money well I paid 1799 yesterday for the side of vinegar but I needed the side of vinegar I just
bought it bought it because I needed it but other people will then start thinking oh you know the
prices are going up but the prices are going up you've got to just make more money that's that
that's what you've got to do you've still got to support that which you want to see in the world
support the small fisherman if you like fish support the small fisherman that's going out on the
little boat fishing for the bluefin tuna you know and doing it the right way and you know support that
if you want to eat fermented foods but you don't have time to make fermented foods support loving
foods support someone that's doing it the right way you know if you if you really want to have
your own cow but you don't have your own care right now support the human being that has the A2
dairy cows and is doing it the right way you know if you want to Tesla a violet ray machine and
you want to support Zeesh family I've got a Tesla violet ray machine you might only have a
set budget you might want the best Atlas machine you might you might want the best coronavirus
coronavirus green machine you might be like Zeesh I want every single electrode I don't want to
spare any expense tell me how to get it you know there's a grand deposit put it on the work bench
build it for me tell me when it's ready we're good to go or you might be like Zeesh I've only got
800 pounds Zeesh I've only got 300 pounds what have you got you know what have you got you might
not want to do anything you might just want to send a little donation Zeesh go and get your kids
some nice A2 dairy from hill farm real food there's a little donation for you you know it helps
doesn't it's a rising tide lifts or ships I've given so much value here today if you just do one
thing that I shared with you today you're going to get some value could be the essential oils could be
you know learning about going to archive org finding the electro therapy museum and reading a
journal on violet rays or high frequency you know just one thing just do that we'll go to
Western A price foundation and learn about the benefits of A2 dairy go to Clifton farm go to loving
foods and learn about fermented foods go and buy sand or cats is book or nourishing traditions
read some doctor Tom Cowan there's so much that you can do support those that are doing things
the right way and trying to make a difference in this what you can't change the world but if
is that 101 monkey effect of each one of us starts to implement change and is not in a state of
savior complex and is learning something new and is not distracted by all the noise of Epstein and
all this all this all these psych ops that are there to distract you and you focus on what you
want in this world rather than complaining about the problems oh this the immigrants coming over
when I was on the beach the other day and I I met a whole immigrant family there was a mum
a dad and a child on the beach looking at the seaweed and I said hi where are you folks from and
they were like where from Iraq I was like oh wow you probably don't get seaweed there do you
I'm collecting this seaweed I've driven here to Aberyst with I'm taking four sacks of seaweed
I'm taking it home you can put this in your soup you can put this on your allotment garden
that you can have in Aberyst with and grow your own Iraqi or Iranian garden if you want to
they thought I think they thought I was a bit crazy but but at least I tried and then this
Indian couple came over they were from Sri Lanka well they were a little bit more receptive they
were like well actually yeah we live by the sea this is seaweed and I said yes Iadine and they
were talking to me about salt and I said to them the best salt is your and a gray sea salt because
it was harvested by the Bretons it's it's put under the sun and it's from the Bretons the Bretons
are connected to the Cornish the Cornish are connected to the Welsh this is the salt of Wales
but the seaweeds you can get it and you can put it on your land what and he he ate meat so I said
you have your bone broth why didn't you put a little bit of this kombu this is Japanese kombu
but it's on the coasts of Wales you can put that in your soup you could put it in your bath you can
put it on the land you know and the next thing I know I'm filling up my bags the tides coming in
and a gentleman comes next to me and he's the biochar wizard he's like have you heard of biochar
we became friends and now he's offering the free biochar that I can put on my land and I'm going
to get horse manure and sheep manure and cow manure from happy organic cows because you're
you've made the decision okay I'm going to go to the organic farm shop you're at the organic farm
shop you're there thinking oh I'd left some meat they are there thinking oh I'd left some meat
you know but you're at the organic farm shop but unfortunately they're all vegan but while you're
there the organic meat producer that grows you know Welsh ruby or red ruby he shows up
and he's like ah I've got I've just opened up my restaurant I need some leeks today and some
cilantro coriander for the food and then we end up talking to each other and guess well
he's got cows I can get steak from him but I don't need steak from him because I've got my little
steak thing that's going on anyway so but if you go to these places I remember Louise El
hey Louise El hey saying it if you just go to a health shop when you go to a health shop they've
usually got a notice board and the notice board then leads you to other like mines that are also
seeking change so that's what I'm trying to say to you is if you start to make change you start
to change the way you're doing things okay normally I'm going to go to Sainsbury okay but
Sainsbury's is 20 minutes away yet if I drive 45 minutes away I can go to a little farm called
gold hill farm out off the A303 I can go there and I can get my own beef my own organic salad and
when I'm there I'm going to meet other like mines and they might be able to connect me to the A2
dairy they might be able to connect me to the fermented foods because when I go to my organic farm
when I go in the fridge there's a little there's a little lady there that sells a few different
fermented foods then there's the baker down the road I can get some closants from him and you
start to build this little pattern this new pattern of new association new links new connection
and you're building that relationship before the next black swan event happens then you've already
sealed that connection to where your foods coming from because it's very important if you haven't
grown your own food you need to start to implement where is the nearest thing to the food that you
would grow if you couldn't grow it who's doing it the nearest way that you'd want it to be grown
organic in lovely composted soil you know in a remotely good place good water good seed and
doesn't cost too much money so then that's a good thing isn't it anyway hope you got value from
this today this was a bit of a holistic broadcast really looking at the internet of everything because
when you take the internet of everything and you make it into the true internet of everything what
is that that's nature that's the mycorrhiza that's the fungal layer that's the soil fertility that's
the expression of the beautiful apple tree the beautiful pear tree the beautiful quince tree that's
the expression of a happy chicken happy duck egg and all the things that help to create an optimum
internet of everything which is nature nature's the true internet of everything so you support all
those things that come from nature you get out into the sun and you do the best that you can
that's a good thing anyway hope you got value from that that was today was on the good in food
the good in medicine and the good in technology and we can even elevate it and just throw in the
great because you're worth it okay thanks for watching this was these hope you got some value
how you can help this is this is going to go on to youtube you could like it and you could
subscribe to it and you could share it if you want to I don't know if it really makes any
difference but it's worth saying it because because it's worth doing I think it's there's some valuable
information here today and it's probably worth sharing with those that you love anyway thank you
for watching Con regards from Wales we are Saturday the 7th of February 2026 have a great day
