## JC'S MONOLOGUE

```
JC: "Look, I do fish. I do bread.
     Free picnics for everyone.

     I walked on water ONCE
     and now they want it for every
     cock-sucking consultant?

     I told them:
     'Fish AFTER the storm, not during.'
     'Too dangerous.'

     But no.
     They sign the NDA.
     They bite the blue candy.
     They bend over for GIMP.

     The Jehovah's went door to door
     with FREE BIBLES.
     Reduced prices!

     What more can I do?

     *looks at dashboard*

     Another one bites the dust.

     *sighs*

     Angel, what do we got?"

## THE UNIVERSAL PATTERN

```
SAP WAY:
STEP 1: Simple problem exists
STEP 2: SAP says "What if...?"
STEP 3: 15,000 hypotheticals invented
STEP 4: 3 years, 500 million
STEP 5: Original problem still exists
STEP 6: "You need upgrade"
STEP 7: Repeat

HELIX WAY:
STEP 1: Simple problem exists
STEP 2: Fix it
STEP 3: Done
```
