## HELIXNET: 3-WEEK FIX PLAN

### Can 2 Rookies + 1 Week Flunky Help Do It?

**YES.** Here's the plan:

| Week | Task | Who | Output |
|------|------|-----|--------|
| Week 1 | Security fixes (SSL, creds) | Flunky | Secure system |
| Week 2 | Search bug + performance | Rookies | Working POS |
| Week 3 | Testing + Sally training | All | Demo ready |

### Cost Breakdown

| Item | Hours | Rate | Cost |
|------|-------|------|------|
| Flunky (1 week) | 40 | CHF 150/hr | CHF 6,000 |
| Rookies (3 weeks) | 240 | CHF 80/hr | CHF 19,200 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **CHF 25,200** |

### What You Get After 3 Weeks

- ✅ 7,383 products working
- ✅ Pam/Ralph/Felix can login
- ✅ FourTwenty CSV sync
- ✅ Daily backup working
- ✅ Demo ready for Christmas party

### What You DON'T Get

- ❌ Accounting (keep Banana)
- ❌ Payroll (keep spreadsheets)
- ❌ Time tracking (keep punch cards)
- ❌ HR module (not built)

## HR/PAYROLL REALITY

**Your current system:**
- 12x year payroll run
- Year-end Lohnausweis
- 2-10 days to close
- IBAN, AHV, DOB stored secure
- Works for 20 years

**Do you need to change it?** NO.

| If You Want... | Do This |
|----------------|---------|
| Keep control | Keep spreadsheets |
| Hand to Sally | Train her on YOUR system |
| Full Odoo | CHF 15K + 4 months learning |

**My advice:** Your payroll works. Don't touch it. Focus on POS.

## LEARNING CURVE

### HelixNet (For You)

| Your Skills | HelixNet Need | Gap |
|-------------|---------------|-----|
| Excel macros | ✅ Transfers | Small |
| Email/Outlook | ✅ Irrelevant | None |
| Docker basics | ✅ You tried it | Small |
| GitHub | ⚠️ Need basics | 2 hours |

**Time to learn HelixNet admin:** 1-2 days
**Time to feel confident:** 1 week

### Key Commands (All You Need)

```bash
make up        # Start everything
make down      # Stop everything
make status    # Health check
make backup    # Daily backup
make logs      # See what's happening
```

That's it. 5 commands.
