Aboard, but if you place, make it become. Many additional hoisted for Soundcloud go on. Hello. Hello, Mr Kennel. Is this a good time or you is it right now? OK so where do we live off? You have any birthday party yesterday and you were saying that the presents were flying at the door and that stuff went. Yeah, that took me to let you. Let's see a movie together. What would you see? Joe is a good hot knives now. Do you know what that is? It's with Daniel Craig, who was the James Bond. Yeah. And so we kind of this is the third movie. In the it's a series he plays AA detective who's, I think he's from like Louisiana, New Orleans or something like that. So and so this one was called. Oh, good man. Raging or something like you would remember what's going. So is it all good? Yeah, so it's it's about a priest. Who's he's a new priest and it seems like in it's an Albany, New York and. He's a young guy as a priest, he opens up with him punching another young priest in the face. And so he's getting reprimanded and if you've been a boxer, but he had, he had killed somebody in a ring and so. He, like, you know, he felt like a lot of hate in their life and so he became a priest. And so he's going to, he's gonna get, he's talking with the like he's gonna be kicked out of the priesthood of these boys thinking blue stockings the, the the I guess the police ship and the other priests, they're like it's almost like AA judge here and kind of thing and they say well we're gonna we're gonna transfer you we're gonna assign you to a small guy that's up N. There's like you know there's not a lot of parishioners there at the left getting kind of old and you know nobody kind of likes him so. I'm gonna send you there. And so he goes up to the parish and the the priest head to the print is Josh Brolin. I don't know Josh Brolin is he's I'm trying to what he's been in. He was in Men in Black and with the one where he was, it was back in time. I don't know. He's a, he's a, he's a good character actor and. And so he's a very bitter. Well, listen, boys. We don't need the whole plot. So how's banning the boys? If that's good, he's good. We're just doing year end right now. It's it's actually been quite cold here. It's normally in December isn't that cold. So you can't really do too much work outside. So we're just trying to get all the Diane and him are doing all the counting part and Tom and I have a few projects that we're doing and then. In this January I have. It's called IPM. It's like I have to do all the paperwork, so when I use pesticides. And because I use quite a bit of herbicides, mostly fungicides for the turf and so because of the anterior government, I have to create a binder and I have to upload everything on the on the website. There's an IBM website and so it's about a it's about a 2 to 3 week job, but I don't usually do it until in November. So but I can sort of start. I've been doing paperwork throughout the season so I've just got to a lot of **** paperwork. OK, this is like paperwork season, eh? Yeah, it's it was, it's, you know, we're doing this now for almost 10 years. This is under the negative government and. So actually, Ontario is probably the most regulated province or state. North America, lots of stuff, professor. Golfing for golfing. Well, I see golf courses are allowed to use pesticides and herbicides. But like and and farmers can use this stuff too. But the farm. But for the average homeowner, they're not allowed to use stuff. So that's that, a cosmetic thing. So I'm allowed to use it, but I have to. I have to. Yeah, that kind of sucks, yeah. It is what it is. It sucks. But I mean it's like one of the business. You have all kinds of paperwork and tell me how did it go this year? Would you have a Goodyear? Goodyear, so, so when Covid hit, we actually, so Covid would hit sort of us here in I guess March of 20, 20 February, March of 2020. And it was. So normally we would have opened on April first and we weren't able to open till May 15th I think. And we were only allowed to open because we were deemed at that time because you could do it outside and you didn't listen, you had to keep 60 feet away from everybody. **** this. Shoulders I think you were doing like an indoor activity, like say you were playing volleyball or basketball. You were **** You weren't allowed to do that. So and like I'm thinking at that time you couldn't even go on the malls or whatever, like it was really bad, everything shut down, but it was good for golfing then. So you're **** lucky. You know, that's amazing. I didn't know that. What's even, what's even funnier is because in 2028 and 2020, sorry, 2018 and 2019, our revenues actually had been going down. So they've actually picked up for. That was golf in general, yeah. But all of a sudden it went. It went the opposite, right? Yeah. Because of **** Because of Covad, I guess. Because they said I gotta get out and do something, right? Like, **** me, yeah. Exactly. So golf actually benefited. So golf overall benefited in the whole. It wasn't just you was like all golf courses. Even said like the. Conservation authorities in our area that have already trails and hikes and you know, stuff like that, they all saw huge increase of membership. You know the RBG would have a huge use. Anything outside actually based it now has to tell me pulled it as a as a tapered off of it now or is it basically the same or? No that's that's the because they get people got in the Gulf and started getting into it right and. So we would see like so let me have like we saw a lot of Rep hockey players. So the problem with. A lot of Rep sports here in Canada is it's almost a bit of a racket. So they don't want you to play. The coaches, whoever is involved in each sport doesn't want you to go play the other sport. So. So if you're like a Rep hockey player, they're doing it, they're doing it all year long. It's not like they have the summer off to not play it on to you. No, they're playing hockey in the summer. They're playing hockey in the spring and the fall, which when we were growing up you would do hockey in the winter and then you might do baseball in the summer or you maybe not even doing sport. So, so we got all this, all of a sudden there was all these hockey players and all these volleyball players and all these basketball players and you know, and even, I guess they weren't really very loved to do baseball. All these people were coming to play golf and. Golf is, I'm like it's, it's like you're not going to get injured playing golf, you know? So I think the coaches and the trainers and the parents of these other sports. Are too busy and do something right. So sitting on your **** waiting for the **** place. The other thing, the other thing we see is we see a lot of immigrants and a lot of women who and who a lot of women, but a lot of immigrants are the ones that are getting university degrees and. Different ones that can actually afford the call. So and we get some trivia trades people too, they're the ones that golf you can take. We can't afford it. So, but I mean for a lot of the Asian, the the lot of Asians here. To India and from other parts of the you know China and Korea and they don't tend to really play a lot of other sports and it was kind of one of these sports is that like tennis or something that's like **** anybody could play golf and swing a rack or at least they think they can and you know it sounds like a team sport where you got to join the club and and be in a peaceful it's a 1 as you can do it a one man thing. So I know that was at Swiss life and some guys. I mean, this guy didn't like his job. He's just **** waiting to be dead. But when it came to golf, oh **** You know, and I've got every **** thing. You can measure **** **** size and compare it to his **** club size and all that **** and, you know, all the gizmos and if you mentioned golf is a God and it's like, oh the **** you know, get a life, buddy. But that was his life. That was his **** life. What's that? You've not hurting anybody, no. No, in Switzerland, if you got to be, they actually you got to take a test. I know it sounds **** weird, but it's like, no, you can't. You know what I'm talking about? Like, it's like if you're not **** good. Yeah, what the **** And it's like this guy. You got that there. You do not have that. No. And in fact we have raw Chapel, which is the perfect for the beginners, right? That's right. That's what we're made for. Yeah. So we get a lot of, we get a lot of good golfers who will bring their family and friends and you know, their spouses are. Never played golf before. He'd be stupid to take him out on a big eight people golf course, 'cause they might actually not like it, right, 'cause they might eat them up so badly. So that's all we had. So go Rock Chapel is a great place to introduce. And then what about the the Gulf of Mini? Do they still? They don't get it or what? Or they are they? The gulf in many behind the clubhouse, right, like it was always kind of like, you know, well, I thought it was called golf and mini. No, no. It's why you call it mini putt or or putt putt, but we call it a putting course OK. That helps us probably in the last 10 years. Use Google is well, is well, is Google. Google, google, right? Pay anything to Google. But we get a lot of like, I make customers come from Milton 's, I get people coming from Branch, I get people from downtown Toronto. Well, you know, I guess maybe they just completely they're looking for things to do and and you know, maybe the big golf courses are **** big money. And then they, you know, and they got a book ahead and all that **** They said let's just **** drive over there and just **** play golf and maybe wait 1/2 an hour and have a beer or whatever. Two times, yeah. But then, you know, they could do the, the, the, what do you call it the, the, the driving range. And they could play golf with many, you know. Google, we have a much like like we don't have to advertise for that like and we used to have to put ads in newspapers, you know? I want to tell you a story about Google. So I'm up and this was, I was in Amsterdam. You know, I don't go to Amsterdam every day, but I was there at the 420 Cafe, like the classic 420 cafe, nice place. It's going pretty good. And then I said to the guy, he was serving me or he gave me a big drawing room there. And I said, hey buddy, I'm going to, I'm going to do a post on Google. You know, and I said OK, I'm going to type it all in, get the lashes. And I said listen, what do you want you to do is take a couple pictures, okay. Then you know what to take pictures of because you know. And so he did it and said OK ready. Now I'm going to send it. And I pressed send and I swear 30 **** seconds later the whole place was so **** wall to wall, people. Because they're all making crowds of people at their tourists. They're like, where do we go for a smoke, you know? And all of A, sudden the whole place is filled right up and it was like for half an hour to this or 20 minutes. It's just just lineup. They're taking people and they're selling all something kind of the middle kind of like filled out and slowed down. And then I looked at the guys and said. With the post and they're like, yeah, I guess that'll **** work, man, you know? Yeah, so it does work. There's something there to it. But you know what? It's good to hear. We have a. Ours is a 4.6, so that's not bad. You're never going to get a 5, right? Yeah. 600 reviews. Yeah, nice. That's actually pretty good. That's pretty good because a lot of people don't do reviews, you know, they don't even **** press the star or nothing, right? But they're they're looking. And it's organic. You can tell when. Sometimes you can tell when, when places are for reviews, you can tell inorganic. Well, you know there was a funny thing that you see the problem at the 3rd 20 this cafe, these guys come in and then like see I went in there said hey listen, you know, tell me what you got, what do you recommend? And he said OK, this is better, you know. And he says a lot of these **** guys come in and then they're amateurs and they're like hey, give me these cookies and do that. And then what happened is he said so one guy says he complained on the dude and says so **** Stole there and then they end up in the **** hospital and he bleeps the **** So buddy, like we told you not to **** eat all the cookies and **** you know? And you're going to get **** doped and fall over in the street, you know what I mean? Like, it backfired on them. Stuff was too good. So, you know, it depends on the business, but I guess it was kind of funny because. It's tough to get. You know, you can get that. When this first came out, we were scared, right? Because, you know, yeah, they can say anything they want. Your competition can even better. Yeah, yeah. Well, this is it. Hey, you know, this is it. I mean kind of we don't get, we do get some bad reviews. We had one guy complain about the price like. You know, like, that's just stupid. Like, if you don't like the price, don't come like, well, I know he he's a no. It's kind of like you go for dinner and it's like, I had the dinner and then the **** check comes in. It's like, oh **** I mean, you know, this should have been 35 bucks and they charged me 45 is like, you know, he didn't feel like he got value or something. You know, some guys you can never **** Please, you know, there's some guys. It just, it doesn't matter what they **** do for these **** It's almost. But I'll tell you some, Paul, a lot of people won't **** give a God review like I do reviews. I do Google reviews like I do that, you know, every once in a while I'm kind of like a million **** pictures of stuff I've done. And they they say they like me, but I will. Unless. **** then I **** tell them that. **** avoid that one star and a bunch of **** there. I left, but 99% of the time I won't see something bad because it's it's just you know, like yeah it's. I don't have anything good to say then, but but sometimes I ruin them. You know, if I got a really bad I'll go out of my way and go like that, revert that **** place. But I think I did that on one campground. They were real deckheads there, but you know, they took the Swiss like **** There is some good. From the whole Google thing, if you have like you know 4.9 and and you know 600 reviews, you kind of like that, that has got to be either really **** good or or somebody or somebody'd manipulating the **** right? You know, so. 4.9 But Julia, Tony yeah, you got 20. Crack it. Probably exactly, you know? Yeah, exactly. Well, this is what they do. Yeah, that's right. There were certain numbers. Having 600 is quite a few reviews. Yeah, yeah. There's not 600 golf courses in the area, you know, and they wouldn't be. No, no, no. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, that's good. That's good. So that actually works for you. Yeah, that's nice. And we you know what at the end of the day I really said to the to Tom and then it's always about the product. So you know people will go to a Starbucks because they like the products, right. People have stayed in line to buy an Apple product because they like the product. You know all the marketing everything is one thing. But if the product is not is not a quality product people don't want it. And so as long as you have a reasonable price with high quality product you're going to do OK. Well you know I'm into the, I'm into the fair stuff you know like just give them a **** fair shake. Don't **** him around. And you know, and if the customer comes back and say, hey, the **** clubs broken, yeah, here's a new club, you know, whatever. You know, like give him a coupon, it's like set them on their way or. In the church. So for us it's the, it's the church at the end of the yeah but I mean nobody's coming back and saying hey listen, I had a **** **** golf game and I could scored like 150. So I'm a loser, give me my money back like this not happening, right. You know, I mean. Restaurant how can you put a good quality smooth that is a place for people come forward, right. Well, I mean that's that's that's a restaurant business. You. I think they can figure that out. I mean if anywhere **** reviews would work, that should happen there. Similar to a restaurant in that chest that I have inputs like I have. I have, like I have to spend money in order to put out a product. Like I have to, just like a restaurant I have to buy. Yeah, but but you don't. You don't put out like 20% of your income and marketing and advertisement, you know, like the restaurants do that. Yeah. Well, that's right. That's right. The restaurant business. It sounds like you got the right idea. It's true. Like just **** give him a good show, a good value for their money, and keep the **** grass cut properly. And you know, and don't spray people with **** herbicides in the face and or run them over with the lawnmower, right, you know? Our green jar. How good? The cheese and the fairways, I bet, because I get a lot of them. They just **** The guys are a bunch of hacks and they're they're like, not the hacks. I mean, the maintenance guys are just the hacks, you know what I mean? They don't. You're there personally. If small enough, you can maintain it and get at it. Say is, you know, I like to cook, for instance. And the secret ingredient in cooking, they always say, is love, right, 'cause every every chef has access to the ingredients. Yeah, but it's how you put ingredients. Like when you. Get a, you know, a cake or a croissant in Paris. You know, they're just using butter, sugar and flour. It's not like they're using some sort of magic. Well, no. Some guys know how to **** bake a croissant versus another guy. What they do is they have these ones that are scaled, you know, and. But it's technique. Yeah, well, this is it. I mean, it's like anything, right? I mean, you know, you know the story that the plumbers, right? You know, the three things the plumbers have to know. Well, you know, it's like every every Thursday it's payday. Like that's rule number one. Like they get paid well and and then the second one obviously is don't lick your fingers if you're a plumber, but the best one is the 3rd one that every **** **** is a potential customer. So really easy formula there. Everybody, sooner or later. Here. My my problem is, not everybody needs to play golf, yeah. Well, you get a longer overhead too. I mean, the plumber is just got a van and you know, one man show can do it, right? When you know this is what they're telling us now, they say, listen, that's probably the career to go for cleaning up **** It's because all the other jobs are going to be taken over by the **** computer. You know, this is an insult to people's intelligence, I'll tell you that. I mean, this is this is ridiculous. Anyways, they'll figure it out in a couple years that, you know, maybe we still need people, you know, and and they're already hiring the people back. It's all as **** **** But anyways, I, you know, I don't think you're going to be affected by the **** business. No, no, it's anything. It's anything. I think people explicitly with covert, they realize how much they need by product. Yeah. Yeah. Well, this is it. I think it's just got like, you know, getting getting back to feeling the Earth, right. You need to get outside and touch grass. Yeah, yeah. No, this is it. Yeah, yeah. You know, next year will be maybe, you know, bare feet **** golfing. Who knows, right? For weirdos or something with purple hair, but. Forever. But that's not just for no, I listened. That's what I did. Like I don't go walking a lot. I should be doing more walking. But the day they gave me the first meds, like I had **** diarrhea, like 1st **** thing in the morning, just total mess. And I felt like **** and you know the people are yelling and screaming. I like I got to get the **** out of here and I just, I was like what happened? Actually there was this nice guy here. His name was Ralph and he's just been waiting for them to take him away and put him in jail for three months. He probably had a parking ticket or some **** who knows? Poor **** guy. I was like **** crying to see him go. And it was really bad. It was so **** bad. And was there, the girl I gave the phone to and she was banging on the window waving him goodbye and and he he left and you know, I sort of gave him a big hug as he left and it's like **** man. Such a nice guy and I don't know how he handles it. I mean this guy like I, you know, he just doesn't say anything. Is it so nice? His English was very good and very intelligent and they're just **** people over. I've got to tell you what happened, Paul. This is let me tell you what happened. So I go to the hospital, right? And then they say OK, we transfer you over there. They put me in solitary confinement for three days, OK and then I'm there for the like the 3rd day or whatever. I don't know if it's morning, night or whatever because it's only dark, you know what I mean? So all of a sudden like, they wake me up, like I'm sleeping in the corner and again woken up and it's like, you know, like what? And there's like the half the **** police forces in my **** room, you know? And they said, what the hell is going on? And she's just, this is like a **** They don't have real talk. Like the doctors aren't Swiss. This is like some Ukrainian witch. And I'm telling you, that wasn't the first one I've seen. So she's there like, it was Uncle Goose and she's like yelling at me. You got **** two options. You either take the **** pill. Doing an injection, i'm like what wrong? I couldn't even ask what it was. And the one answer boom, they **** 20 cops. I'm serious. They **** smashed me down on the floor on my face they **** each got one got they're both all of them are **** kneeling on me. I'm like holy **** I said my lord God. Give them so they don't know what they're **** doing. What the hell happened to Switzerland? And this is this is like the **** communism. And then I talked to the guy like the, the, the, the the nurse lead because he's the guy that doesn't know the difference between a notebook and a computer. And I talked to him when I because when I made it here and he says yeah it's this sort of say, but it's been going on for 10 years and it's not uncommon at all. And I said this is insane. When you guys, that is totally criminal. You can't **** do that to people. And they're like, they don't care. They don't **** care. And these cops have absolutely zero empathy and and and like, and then there was the other girl. Listen, so I'm talking to Sandra. She left today. Her mother came to pick her up. And she's like, you know, maybe say 4550. I don't know what age she is, but she's, you know, well in her forties. And you know what? She had a runny rose. And and and she was, she had some like like coughing and she was spinning to get it out, you know, like there was not nobody spit, but so they think you're **** you're a criminal for spitting. So they put her in the **** When she got, they put her in the white **** room for three days too. She says solitary confinement because they were like afraid that she was spit on people. What the **** This is so sick here. I'm telling Paul, I don't know what it is in Canada. I know you guys went through that Justin Trudeau **** **** but. We got it's just **** nuts here. It's nuts. I mean, we got to separate every **** piece of paper and it's just sick. It's sick, sick, sick. It is just the toxins and the. It's it's too much. It's every and everybody knows, everybody knows. Everybody asks. I say, hey, how's it going? It's **** heavy. One girl, she's the nicest nurse here. She's got the he's your Bob or whatever, you know, she looks like Iranian or whatever. And she's like from my area, like the my end of the woods and I'm in like the other. She takes her an hour and 15 minutes to get on train to get here. She doesn't have a car, so she spends two and a half hours or more, you know, 'cause you got to wait for the train all that **** like just to get to, you know, this is. And they pay the ticket. You know, the train ticket, but she that's like **** another two and a half hours to a day. You call people. Obviously. This is what that happening now is your life uniform. What? I got a pregnant room. Like I'm in a normal **** You know? This is normal now. Like I'm in. Yeah, I got out of the. I wouldn't be calling you from the white room, you know, and this is another trick. They have two. What's that? No, no. I got one medication that said I haven't had. This is the second day I had it at basically done the nice girl, I told her. He said you're the best nurse here. You actually listen to people because these guys are so **** busy. They got 20 things on their mind. It's like a cluster **** And so that when you're talking to them they're not listening because they got 20 things on their minds. So just nothing gets absorbed. Just waiting to get your you get out on the 24th. Well, this is what he said. He says, listen, it takes seven days for the **** to adjust and he should have gave me the heads up on the **** in the morning. You're going to feel like crap. The first day I didn't realize it was that bad, but you know, II feel better now? I mean, this morning it was a **** nightmare. Get another week to go, another six days. Five days. Because no, I've done two sets, so I got another five times into 24. I don't know what. What's the 20? Let me just look here, it's the 17th today. I just got to. We better check this at the 24th is Wednesday and you know the 24th here. The 24th is Christmas. For them it's like that's Christmas. The 25th is like our Boxing day for them, but there's nothing open. Of course, but they celebrate in Europe on the 24th. But I don't care, I'm not into this Christmas **** And the I'm never was anyway. I mean, yeah. Well, I was afraid that, well, I expected I was going to be on this because I came in the 6th and Sylvie says, oh, you're going to stay for 30 days. And you know, normally they put you 30 days in the hole. But like we went voluntarily. And I said, Lisa, I want to get some medicine. Let's just get on with this and and for the first 7 days they just will try this today and try that of good guys **** easy. I'm you know my body's doing convulsions on this **** And like last Friday I tell you Paul, this doctor, he's like this guy doesn't speak English. I mean like what? How can you be a doctor and you 0 that's possible. No, don't **** cover this guys an idiot. He's actually a masochist. He likes to see people suffer. That's that's what that girl told me. And I said hey, you know, I think you're right because he gave me some **** on Friday night. It took me a day and a half to **** get over that. It was a disaster. And it said, what the **** are you giving that **** for? And he shows up, they can't even **** talk. And he wears the same **** outfit every day. This got some homosexual **** I don't know. So I ripped another **** hole right through his **** He's got two holes now in his **** And I said, you get your **** **** out of your. I never want to see your face here. You're no **** doctor. You don't help anybody under no income. And I told the nurses, I said. What's that? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Like, no, no, no, no, no. Some. This is the problem. You Paul, nobody speaks up. They know and everybody means an **** not, but they told me that guys a **** he's a **** **** and but nobody speaks because if they say anything, they're **** So the the nurse is just and they're all just **** and put their heads down low. But I think they were all **** glad that somebody **** stuck up and it doesn't **** matter. No, no, it was the best thing I did to get that. Because if I would have continued with that guy, he would have **** me over again and again and again. He was changing the pumpkin recipe every night and then he wouldn't write it down. And then the nurses are like, well, what do you take? What do you want? What is he? And I'm like, what the **** You know, and every day it was a different recipe. And then the Friday night, he just leaves me to **** die. And I had to wake up Saturday like a **** **** **** I mean, unbelievable. So when he shows up like on a Tuesday and it has it going, I'm going. You **** you, **** you every **** day when you're doing. I said you're not a doctor. There's no way you're **** doctor. You don't speak **** English, you don't know nothing. And you know, and I just ripped him. I ripped him up and he did. Got **** put his tail between his leg. He **** laughed. Haven't seen him here at all since. Never. Showed his face again here and like he services other people. No, this these guys are **** dangerous, Paul. Trust me, they're the ones that were responsible for **** everybody up. No, I'm serious. It **** me off. And that's the thing, Paul. I'm bipolar. I see a great race. I know an **** when I see him and I called him out. People lie all the time. I don't know if you know this is this is common that people think the lion is okay it's not. It's like, I'm sorry, 2 + 2 is 4. Don't tell me it's **** green and blue or whatever. It doesn't **** add up. So you want to listen? You know what I'm talking. You're just as bad as me, Paul. Little different, you see? **** You're pretty worse than me, so listen. No, I could call this. You gotta understand the **** Paul Paul stopping. They **** is standing in my **** head, jogging me in my **** **** with needles. You're worth my life. You know this is i'm in a **** hospital mental ward OK. You know, like, we don't need to talk about this. Move along. Nothing to see here. Nothing to see here. Let's fly. That's fine. Okay. Let's talk a little bit of other. How's Diana doing and how is Lauren and not those guys. Well, yeah. She has two little girls, Sophie and Nora, I think. I think Sophie was sent. I think Sylvie sent because she sent us a like a picture and stuff. We sent, I think we sent something else. So we sent us for the second baby. To her and and she sends a postcard or something like once or twice a year or once a year if that. But but I'm glad that she's happy there. So she's happy there, right? Yeah, yeah. And then, you know, that's good. So she's in good shape. Your your phone is like **** now. It's like **** Hectic city. You can flush it's OK it's fine. Go ahead, flush. And. We do the. Whatsapp. I know you're an apple. You don't do outside. Yeah. And I guess. Yesterday morning, yeah, it was yesterday morning. Have you seen, have you seen the grandchild? Have you been with the great? Did you go to the see them in Scotland? No, no. Guy doesn't like to fly. Well, nobody likes to **** fly. I mean, it's just, you know. Well, you can take a boat, you can take a **** boat, then you know it's not that bad. Lauren was here. I guess for almost two years now for Tom's wedding and so. At that time and and Lauren was going to come sort of this fall kind of thing and but right right now at the moment our our influenza no, no, no what it was they're. Knocking on my door again. Hold on a second. Yeah, Sara, how do you is he charging him? Right. And how charged him for him? No, and and an hour it won't be ready. No, but it's it doesn't matter. You know, 1%, you know the latter, I'm telling you. Yeah but it has to charge overnight. Okay it has a charge overnight, but you give it to me to. Of course. See you in the morning. Like first thing at breakfast, you know, 8:00, not at 6 in the morning. OK. Have a nice evening. Maybe I see you later where I go for a smoke OK. So I love them, Paul. That's Laura. I gave her the phone. I mean they said like I got a real phone. Felix the the guy on the phone and this other was a **** **** **** and she killed the battery. And I told her, I said you got to let it charge. And she would let it charge like five or 10% and use it again. You know, she's too anxious and of course, you know, **** the battery up. I gave it to her like three days ago or whatever last week, and then she was just going crazy on the phone. I said just give me that thing back now, 'cause I had my SIM card in there, you know, like I have two SIM cards. But anyways, I took the SIM cards out, so she doesn't have any SIM cards in that. But it's good for, you know, search for the web anyways. So yeah, go on. What were you saying? So Lauren was going to come, but the measles was a little bit high here. No, I can't. She under 12, 12 months, you can't get a measles waxing. So and they're going to be coming this summer, they're going to count themselves. That's nice. Yeah, that's good. To travel like for a month. Oh, she's just coming by herself and her husband hanging. Or is he coming too? Can you leave our job? We want to see what happens. If you want the job, we want the cop. So. He's he does. He's a web. He designs websites and stuff like that. He actually works for a company that they do carbon offsets. So if you're feeling guilty about your plane flight, Oh my. God. Oh my God. Holy **** But I mean, like what? A dragon? Get a, get a real little, add some real value. I'm not so sorry, Paul, and I never don't mean it that way, but I know I hear a lot of like that. I think that's just garbage. It's just garbage nonsense. I mean curbing. Well, it's overkill. This is. I mean, a lot of this is **** You know that, right? It's just **** It's just. It's just. I'm like, I don't see Jesus isn't immediately, because I don't. I'm not gonna tell people I don't. Well, of course you wouldn't hear **** facing the public, right? I mean, **** Can't even do yourself. You have to do that for me. People need to know that they're getting **** lied to. And if you want to say, hey, I'm going along with the lie, that's your choice. But I'm not. I'm not going along with the lie. That's simple as that, you know? What do you care? What is it? That's nothing to do with you. It sure does. This is the point. It **** has a lot to do with me. It's all over the **** It's all over. No, it does. You don't. You don't live in a switch. You have no Nepal. You're just **** talking out your **** now. You've got no idea. And you know what in your **** **** shoes are like here. No idea. This is **** hell on earth. We're the most of the **** dragon here in Switzerland. This is the richest country in the world, like on a per capita basis. Okay. So we got people with their **** noses stuck right up to the **** sky. And if you don't have the right shoes, the right **** car and all that, oh, you're not. And I don't **** give a **** about that stuff like money is not what I **** love. But they you can have all the money in the world. But you know what, Paul? You can't buy love. And these people are **** They think they can buy love and they can't. They're **** **** in the head. And then there's another thing, Paul, let me tell you about Swiss people. The the the ones the French part of Switzerland. Of course they hate the France and. Italian port of Switzer. They hate the Italians and the German speaking part. They **** hate the Germans. That war has been. Remember the war of the what **** war is it now? World War Two and ever. Would you **** give it up already? And that's just we are and interrupt soon as I start speaking German and the guy is over 50 or something. He. His finger at me in my face and says you must start speaking, sister. Going to go well, I'm still turning in German. They won't speak German. No Swiss person speaks German. It's either they speak English or Swiss German or nothing. They will not speak. They can't, they can't finish a **** sentence in German. They'll start the first two words in German and finish it in Swiss German. It's just a natural instinct to be **** **** and unlikely got all these immigrants coming in trying to learn German. They got some German and they just and the Swiss will just **** them over at every opportunity. So it does. The immigrants are not working out well in Switzerland and were flooded all over Europe with immigrants and Germany, Austria, Switzerland, big **** that's that's that's the whole of Europe. So we could hit heavy in the UK poll. They get raped like women are getting raped regular like hundreds of rapes per day. This has been going on for years. The cops just looked the other way because we can't you know, go against the limit. It's so **** much New World Order garbage going on. I'm telling you, Paul, if you think this is **** normal, it is not. People are walking around with absolutely no hope of the future is ever going to improve. And I'm not kidding you. And this is not my I purposely asked people say, hey, how's it going? That's **** hard. How's the money? These **** tight and no wearing big **** Paul. And you. You might not have that because you're in a nice business, you're playing golf and everybody's happy duty, but the real world out there is a **** nightmare and I'm not making that up at all. That's the that is the truth, and it's hard. But people are breaking down. They're breaking down. They can't handle it. Idea. So I started in Switzerland. A many, many **** know when you lived in Switzerland, it was completely different. OK this is. And I know I was here at 40 **** years ago. This is not the same place i'm leaving Switzerland. Paul, Paul, Paul, listen to me. I'm leaving Switzerland as soon as I can. I'm probably leaving this year. Like literally soon as I get out of here, I'm getting in my van and I'm **** driving in my. My goal is to get to Greece, but I'm going to Croatia. I already did like, because you go to Croatia and then down. Towards Greece. And my girl was to go to Greece and I said, you know, two years ago we were in Croatia, we did the Max Eagan tour a little bit all over the top of Croatia. Yeah, I'm getting the **** out of Switzerland. I've had it. I cannot **** stand this place. It's sick. It's sick with these people. And I know it's all **** **** in every **** country, no matter where you go, but it's intensely secure. Croatia, how would you be able to get around? I got my van. I got a van. I got a camper van. I could just **** drive. I like it. Like they all speak English. The love it to speak English. They actually know. They know how to speak English. **** Swiss. They're just a pain in the **** to deal with. They just, they literally they just. If you're not, if you don't the first you have to understand, Paul. You're not getting it. You don't understand. You think you know, but you don't. As soon as I open my mouth, the first word I say is just half the word. They go, oh, you're not from here, you're not Swiss. Now it's time to **** you over. And that's what they do. And they're like, where you from? This is what they do, where you from or you know, originally Canada or when you're going back. They were like, hey **** **** I got more **** Swiss blood. You **** **** And that's what they are, just **** in the all over. All over. They feel like, hey, we're being invaded here. We're always being invaded here. No, because of **** all the time. Hey, that's actually the reasons you're saying, well this is it. But II knew what you see for me, Paul II was saying I was the same thing. I didn't want to go back. I like had to make that choice. Like it was back in 2000 and I said okay, I'm going to do it because I wasn't like I'm going to do it halfway. I'm okay, I'm going to **** command, i'm going to give it a shot and I'll do the best I can. Well, I've been kind of stuck here back and forth and you know how it goes. But no, it hasn't really improved. I mean, it's great for the money. You haven't. Joseph's having a good. **** solar panels. He doesn't know what he's like. I hope his his companies making money but they have a their their model is we're going to go and put solar panels on top of the big buildings. So he does the Google Maps. He says oh there's a good spot that once you know and that would work for us and then they do some calculations in the outlet and put this much that model they actually own the solar panels. So we just basically renting instead of putting a vending machine and saying hey, you know, we we, we're going to pay you for the, the, the location of the vending machine. And they said I'll give you 300 bucks a month for the vending machine and and but just that model is never going to work and the only reason it works for him right now is because he's sucking all the money out of it. Maybe they make money. I don't think so. I think it's just they just got the cash flow. This is you know and last time I talked to him, Oh yeah, I'm reinventing the software and then. Have to make sure that I said buddy, you're getting what you're getting into. He's now becoming a software engineer. He's not no **** clue, no **** clue what he's doing. So he'll just and he's not guys in Korea or not Croatia, but in the no that's fine. I don't care. I don't care. I don't get along with Joe Okay. We don't talking anymore. I don't talk to Michael Kennel anymore either. You know, like, I mean I talked to them but you know they, they don't even give me the time of day because I'm the **** sicko. So and and and here's another thing, Paul. Sylvie has not **** called me. Like, she called me once. Well, I've been here and she was supposed to bring me clothes, like and then I called her today. No answer at home, no answer in the phone. You know, like, I hasn't called all week. And I know I didn't miss any calls because she always called the hospital. She didn't call my phone. There was like, here's your wifes on the phone. So, I mean, she doesn't give a rat's **** about me. So you know what's in it for me? Why should I stick around and and then suck **** around here and and everybody's just. Give me money. It's. I'm serious to take, you know, like, I buy some a pack of cigarettes and it's like they're gone, you know, like at this place, you know, but it's like that everywhere. No, I'm not happy in Switzerland, if that's what your question is. No, **** no. Yeah, OK. To go to Croatia? No, I have. I have friends in Croatia. I mean, I made friends there. I've got there. No, she **** she won't. And here's the funny part. OK. Now they get this in Croatia, they have the best dentist at like really affordable prices. She has to get all her teeth removed, like ripped out on the bottom and the top, all of it. And then they put screws in them and it's either you do this, the six screws. Implants the whole **** And she's like, oh **** I can't, you know, she's her mind's like and it's like and she's like, oh, my teeth. And I'm like, I've been saving money like I'm, you know. Putting 35,000 to the side just to get your **** teeth done where to spend like I don't know 50,000 on their **** mouth already and it just never gets done. So now it's they have to, you know we went there we went around. That's what we were doing when we were there. We checked out all the dentists we went to three different ones and she finally found one that she was comfortable with. And but you know she's just scared **** to do it and I'm like well that you know I'm sorry. And you know I'm not pressuring her to do it, but I I'm, I'm prepared when you're ready we're we're going to do it and see all my teeth hurt my and she's always **** complaining. And it's like, well, and I told her that was one of the last conversations I had. So I'm not. No, no. She she's going to be on her own. I'm **** going to leave this woman, Paul. I've had enough. I'm not getting. There's nothing in it for my marriage. There's nothing. It's zero. It's draining on me. And she's actually part of the problem, right? I mean, so, you know. No. What's that? Connecting another question. Yeah, go ahead. Asia, you would you sell the house? No, I just **** She can live in it and you know, she gets it rent free. I don't care. I own it. She didn't pay anything for it and she's never, she's never. She never paid a **** bill or anything. I paid for all her supplies or sewing machines, the whole **** And then she. What's that? Who'd be paying for the property saying is this nothing? That's the whole thing because it's only like 80 square meters and we didn't buy the 4 1/2 Zimmer **** big place. We bought a nice little place because we knew like when we retire we don't need, we don't have kids. See this is the problem. Like a guy like Joan, he doesn't pay any. We have done what nobody does in Switzerland. We paid your **** mortgage down. Nobody in Switzerland is will pay their mortgage down because they personally own it. So it was the business that bought it. So we're in a completely different bracket than 99.9% of the people. You see what I'm saying? They're all all these people. What happens to like a guy like Joe, he's like, actually Joe did well, like, I don't know if you know all over, you know Oliver Rosley, right? You know, Oliver's his buddy. You know Oliver, I think you know Oliver well anyways, is it? Yeah, I said I said Joe, Joe. I sent Oliver and Joe up, you know, because they're the same age, you know. And so Oliver is his best friend and he rents a nice apartment in a, you know, is right downtown. You know, this sucks up the **** fumes and he and he can see a tip of the pilatus and you know, it's it's like fancy little apartment in the same place, same girlfriend. She's not married to his girlfriend. He's been with her for 15. You don't. There's no incentive to get married, in fact. When I got married, I got back to work. This is like November 28th, you know? And the guys are coming up and he says, what, are you **** stupid? Why the **** would you marry her? You know, you want to pay more taxes and I'm like, you know, just just **** **** you know? And this is it. This is it. Guys are not marrying their women and I don't know if even if they have kids, they still don't marry them because they save money. This is as greedy as the **** Like, can you imagine, Paul? That's, I'm sorry to say, but money is not. What the world is made of, I mean, there's, you know, maybe it is, but it's not my world. II don't give a **** about it. I'm not. If I'm destined I'm going to come over to you. I'm going to stand downstairs in the basement OK. So don't worry about it. Like **** make sure there's an extra room and then make sure it's up to date and you can rent it in the meantime okay and do the B and B. But you know, when I give you the call at 68 I'm like, oh boy, I am. My practice broken, you know, and come on over. Make sure we got any bed mattress there all you know. Sure. Don't worry about meatball. Really. Don't **** worry. Are you doing like that? Yeah. It's called the cannabis vitamin. No, listen, Paul, I I'm. I'm in better **** shape than any **** of the kennel boys, I can tell you that. Way better shape. I've seen Dave and **** I thought Dave was in good shape and he came over and takes his teachers out and Oh my, God, **** He'll never get rid of that guy. I don't know. You're probably the. The second best in shape. I don't know. Mike is not married. When I see Mary, I've seen pictures. You're watching. You're watching. Well, I had to. I sit down behind a computer. You guys have an opportunity to get in shape, but you're all **** eating fat **** garbage sugar **** Well, I don't know what you guys are eating. You all fat **** Fat **** How how many powers are you, Paul? How many lbs? Tell me. I'm 255, 255, that's 45 pounds away from the big 300, you know, so you're not most skinny, boy. How, how? How you skinny your mic, right, Mike. Mike is, but he's shorter. But like, Mike is not in good shape. Don't tell me Mike is in great shape. I mean, he's smiling at me. No, he's not in good shape. And what about Mario? How's Mario doing? Like, I mean. Is he actually lost some weight lately? So I haven't seen him later, but he's smarter than you, right? He's bigger than you, right? Really. So because II inspired him to get in shape, you know, years ago he was trying to do something. He knows how to get in shape. He knows that he's dropped the ball. But you know, II, we all dropped the ball at one time in our lives and put on too much weight. But at least I **** took it off and I kept it off and I know how to keep it off. And I don't eat. I don't drink Coca Cola OK. I don't put sugar in my water, you know what I mean? So no, I no, I don't go on my way to **** add calories, you know? At 90 it was. I did the weight today, 90, I admit I'm seven kilos over what I wanted me, but I'm probably five of what, you know, 85 kilos would be the right weight. So I'm 90 kilos. 90 * 2.54 you do the math, okay, but it's probably, it's probably £200, maybe 100 and you know 98 lbs or something. But yeah, I'm trying to keep it under 200 pounds but we're in kilograms over here on this side of the world. Mr Carol, you know, like in Canada, is also working on the **** kilograms. You guys got to get your stuff together over there, man. Holy **** If you go to the gas station, buy gallons. Are you still buying liters? You know what I mean? Come on, you know. You know, this is what I wonder what you guys were in America. Like. Tell me about this Trump guy. What's your opinion about that **** Now tell me. I want to hear it. Tell me. I'm listening. What worse than that isn't? I mean this is. I mean this is like. The evil idea that would be a probably more precise, you know yeah, but and what what about his support for Israel? How do you, how do you feel about that? I don't really get too involved in the whole Israeli Palestinian thing well they've already killed like literally millions OK and what you know what I was there's a Max Egan you don't want to know you don't want to know that what they do is they they 11 day the hospital is getting kids that are shot in the head and the next day they're they're shot in the balls and then they got the next day they're shot in the arm and then the next day they're shot in the so they get the back it's so sick it's OK to call Paul. They're just testing they're coming for you. It's a depopulation program. You might not think so you might last you might be the last guy standing but it's they're coming after all of us. Okay. It's just a matter of time and this New World Order 20. Listen, listen, this is it's sick. It's sick. We we're right in the mouth of it here okay. This is run out of this country. It's one from Switzerland. This is the all the big **** **** are here. They all protected. They got this. Well, it's the Blue Zone thing. What's Blue Zone? So so there's an anthropologist. I can't his name, Dan. I can't remember. She's always blasphemy and actually keep recognizing Blue Zone is this is I'll write this down. Blue Zone. And Dan, is it OK. Alright. Dan, you're saying I want a second? Hang on, here we go, here we go. Is is that like a Youtube channel? No. What is abluezone.com or something? What is this? Yeah, just hang on. Let's forget his name here. But it's Bubner. It's BUETTNU, OK, BUT. TT. PTNERTNERTNER. So Dan is an anthropologist. Yeah. And. So he got a grant. I'm gonna say it's probably about 20 years ago. He got a grant from the National Geographic Society. Yeah. Yeah. And. You've probably read messaging rapid magazines, right? Yeah, I know. Really good OK, yeah. After study, communities around the world where there was more Centurion people that are 100 years old, right? Yeah, yeah. More than than you know, like Japan. Japan would be like that, right? And actually this specifically, there's these little islands off the coast of Japan really. And there's Sardinia, which is, that's the island of beside there, Italy. Typically the people live in that book about OK, yeah. Studied there's AA group of. Latter days, latter days. Yeah. Alright. And there's also some Greek islands. And do you got any names of the Greek islands? Because I'm going down to Greece, you know, OK. But anyways, yeah. Tell me. Yeah, so. So. There's a place in Costa Rica and. So they studied them and they did like genetic, you know, but this all sounds like islands. It's always an island. Is that just because it was easier to do? They're they're basically off the beat path is what they are. OK, yeah. And and a lot of them have been doing, they're part of a community that's. What they have in common and and you know, are there any you know things and there is, it's a lot of them or not, but they probably eating fish too and stuff like that, right. That are eating is the purchase mostly plant aids right? Mediterranean style base maybe? Obviously Japanese are eating what they're eating. Well, they've got a lot of fish, you know, they're not eating meat like red meat so much. At the end of the day, it's mostly pet plant. But the vegetarians, but not really by choice because it's just that's the way it is. I mean, if they, if somebody gave me some faith. They're just eating what they're. Doing what's available, right? You know what's what's? It's a giant part of it. Everything is that they're all physically active. Yeah, probably in the garden picking the vegetables, yeah. Yeah, exactly. We all walk a lot, right? They probably do a little bit of yoga breathing or some sort of like, you know, in the morning the sun comes up and they. Hey, that's part of it. The other part is this. They also are social. So they're they're still, they're probably bartering. I got the eggs and the chicken, you got the, the, the vet, the over here. Yeah. Their family and the community, well, he's probably, because that's the nature of it, right. Like, you know, they have a little markets. They have to do that. We gotta like to walk into the. Yeah. And also the people that they socialize with aren't a bunch of **** **** They're that, you know, just the same situation they are. So, you know, it's like, hey, John, yeah. Like the same thing, you know? Yeah, yeah. On any medication. Living even longer vitamins. From the food, you know, right, right. That's their medicine. And then, you know, I want to tell you something. The best medicine in the world, you know what that is, right? No laughter. Remember that one? No, it's not good. It's the best medicine you're going to find. You can see you're in pain and you're laughing. You're OK. You know what I mean? And if when people are not laughing and they're not and they don't like and they're miserable, they're going to get sick. It's just your body is just you know, it's not a healthy state to be in. You're you're you're in a toxic you're here. Yeah. So II can see that they got a nice community. It's nice weather. The plants are growing and we're we're on an island and there's a beach. You know it's not that bad, right. You know. And they don't care about the money so much. They're not like over chasing the money, you know, it's like, yeah, yeah. Have lower levels of well, you see and I was certainly I wanted to go to Greece because there's the oracle of Delphi, is there? I don't know if you know what that is. You must know. You know what this. Actual real person that existed well it's it's it's basically Wilkins. The answers are inside of you. You know that's the idea and that's the oracle of Delta. You don't physically you don't physically have to go to to Greece but you know I just kind of I wanted to go to Greece because I know it's very nice there and it seems like **** warm weather all the time like it's not snow there so you know and I got I got a couple guys I know down there and like I said I know people in Croatia and and I the thing is my friend is going to Croatia anyway. I think I might just if I'm lucky, I'm gonna hook up with them and, you know, at the same time, he's coming from Mexico and. I need a **** vacation. No, no. I've been locked up for two **** years and. Yeah, I gotta get out of here. You know, it's maybe I come back to Switzerland, but the problem is, in Switzerland you need literally like just one person. You need like 7000 Swiss francs a month, which is about 10,000 Canadian dollars a month. Well, no, it's about 15,000. You're **** The Canadian dollar just went down the **** Percent, I mean it's horrible. So yeah, we need about 7000 Swiss, right? I'm not kidding you. It's not 6000. It's not five. You need seven minimum just to pay the bills and everything. And I told so they said listen we can't afford to live here. This is just II don't want to throw my money away since like if you go to a world age home it costs you over 100,000 a year easily. Like 120, that's just, you know, that's the biggest 10,000 a month right out **** in. And that's just so you can sit on a couch and get three meals a day of **** right. And and they keep you busy with the TV and and people are actually I'd rather do that and stay at home and be lonely by myself. This is what's happening, right. So it's like, Oh my. God. And literally people are waiting to be dead. That's what's going on. And I'm like I'm thinking, hey, I'm free finally I can do what I want. You know, I don't have to do anything. OK. Well, you said Blue Zone and Dan Bufer and so I'll check it out. And it was from National. I got here. National Geographic, I'll. I'll find it. No, I don't type in, Paul. I just asked. I just literally talked to my machine. I I'm like I've got the AI **** I got a tie list. Paul, you don't know what I got. Nobody in the world has got. I've worked my **** **** out. There's nothing like it. So I built the system and there's 20 different services that are built together. I have this unbelievable and it and it runs on my laptop now I'm connecting to the cloud one. But I also have ALLMS on my local, you know it's an HP. But it's only got the the CPU power so I can run the models. I run them right on my machine of course but I pay the 200 bucks a month in a unlimited and II use it every **** day and I'm. I do all sorts of. I built an unbelievable software world class. Nothing like it. I like. I'm telling you Paul, you're not talking to some **** you know kind of flunky here. I'm in the one to 3% top of programmers. I've been doing this for 40 **** years. I know what I'm doing. Really. I mean, I'm the fireman. It's unbelievable. So no, that's what that's what happened, Paul. I put everything into this. I would, I would get up at 8 in the morning and work till **** 12, 1:32 o'clock in the morning for weeks on end because II need this. I got to get this done. I want to have some. To show the world in September and then at the end I said I'm not gonna show anybody this this **** It is too good. They don't get it. It's just way over their **** heads. So I have a machine. No. Because what happened I figured out what's like I was trying to tell you the thing has scraped. They scraped all the Internet everything and every human ever put on the Internet was scraped off, set up and it's now all a bunch of patterns. So there's a little brain inside these LL miss something in there and I just knew it from talking to it and now it's. The tiger. Liberty United. You've made it laughing. He's crazy. No, you haven't seen what? I got no one. And I'll tell you what happened. Listen, I'm at this Zurich. This Zurich, google, you know, meet up thing okay. This is literally one month ago. Okay. Now listen to me. So. This guy, he was like, oh, I've got this presentation, he's from the insurance company. But no, this is something he does on the side. He says, listen, it takes me every month I spend 45 minutes to an hour going through my. This is this. Unbelievable, how pathetic this is, going through my bank statement and sorting out which is the telephone bill and where my, you know, expenses on groceries are and you know, this is and so. He does this whole big, huge **** president horrible presentation that has no idea what the **** is he like he thinks he knows what he's doing. Does he's not a programmer. This is not his background. And so the school in the front puts her hand out and says and he says, you know, I went for 45 minutes, now it only takes me five minutes and it's like it was horrible. This is a **** puke stuff. I mean, and and and so the girl in the front puts her hand up and says, so how long does it take you to make all that he lied. And his normal attribute to me. I tell you this guy spent months on. I know because. He thought I was. I was the first guy at the show, and I was there because I knew this guy and I talked to him and he spent like months on this and it was just garbage. It's just puke. This is like spaghetti code garbage. It's just this is nothing. Anything it's only for his. It didn't say anytime is it's really pathetic and so she puts up Maharaja, did it take you to do that? And she's like are you serious and. Lady, just be quiet. Shut out the next speaker come on. And the next guys like hey, I'm using the LMAI and for for karaoke. And he's like it's like, Oh my. God. Like I'm thinking he's like you guys. And so at the end of the show, like their own meeting, no sign having pizzas and beers. And I'm mostly on over to her. This is like at the end of the show. And I said, you know, I'll give you credit for asking that question and what you did. You're absolutely right. And and by the way, what do you think of the 2nd one? She's the same **** And I said, he said always like this. She said no, this was really bad. And I didn't know her, you know, I just give him. But she was the only one that actually kind of like I talked to some other people. They're just **** they're they're fake people, you know, they're plastic and they're just **** So anyways, that was nearly near the end. And I said, hey. Jimina, I got something I want to show you. So a foot in this is like this is like a month ago, this is actually before I ran into CLOT. So this clot model that I'm using. So anyways, I flopped it up and I said hey look and she goes, hey **** this is cool. We we need this. This is what we need in our place. And her place was called Studio Jab Do. And what they do is they're trying to make films like animated films but consistently, see this is the problem, they can't get the same results. It's like it just doesn't work because they didn't set it up right. And I knew how to do this and that's what my my design. Exactly the same result every time and I can version control it. Serial number. It's all baked in because I know this is what you mean on a high level. Anyways, I did it. So she only seen this for two minutes. That's amazing. And then I felt like and you know, I like and then she's like and we started exchanging the cards, you know, and she gives me like here's my phone and I got AQR code. We don't answer the phone. You know you just figured out. And I went to her website. She had a website. She's APHD. You know she got her PHD here in Bern, Switzerland and she was working like deep into. She actually helped the company so they could study the liver, you know, so they would take pictures of the liver and then they could, you know, make a picture on the computer and then they, I guess they don't want to cut out. I don't really get into it, but this, this is very common. In fact, I had one interview in January for guys that were doing it for the heart and then they figured we could make 3D models and then we can actually test. The people working with them. No, no, no, no, no. Here's here's the catch up. OK. So she she was hired. She was working for Ascension before and then she also had like you know, I read a resume and everything and she had like her own web page and she's written like all sorts of PHD papers, okay. Now she's not like 60 years old, but I'm, you know, she's, you know, PHD, 35 years old, I guess they're 37. I don't really know. But she's in the 30s. I'm just, I don't think she's 25, you know. And so anyways, she was impressed with my subject. So **** this. Exactly what we need. This. So I was IIII sent. I said hey, you know, I finally found her on like Linkedin because you know, she's like, you know, I'm not going to hear you. This is here's my QR code. Like I had to take a picture of her phone and then I know sort of, you know, that's her name. And then I found the website and you know, they like to play. She says oh, by the way, we never answer the phone with a new generation. You know, I guess she's one of these millennials or whatever. She's never answered the phone OK, you know, so after you either send an email or a text or something. So anyways. I saw a gun on Linkedin and I said, hey, I'm Angelo and we met me last week and, you know, I'm going to be at the show at another one. And it would be great if you want to come along and meet, you know. And she says, I'm sorry, I'm not in the mood. I just got fired. She says this is like icing her on Thursday. And he was like literally like probably Tuesday or Wednesday. I don't know. I guess it was maybe Thursday. Like one week later she got fired. So she was she. And I looked at her Linkedin, and she had been in this like. In Switzerland you have this three month trial probate site. So I don't know if they said **** you, you got less different or they said we're not going to go with you, we don't like you because I think they wanted her to write the software and there's no **** way no one could have done that in three months. I'm serious because if you're working for a company, you know you're only working 8 hours a day and I'm working like **** 18 **** hours a day and I'm one man **** and see I'm not working on team. So if you have four or 5 people that all **** arguing all the time about what to do and how to do it, I don't have that argument because I know what I'm doing and then just do it. It's actually, if you're one man, you can move faster if you know what you're doing than 4 or 5 guys, because normally they're not 4 or 5 guys, it'll be like 5, 612 guys. It could be a whole team. Like if he needed an agent or something. A jet. An agent. Yeah, you're like, you could say you're an actor, you have an. You're talking about like like. What are you saying like? I had Hunter. That works for me. I mean, is that what you mean? Yeah. I like to listen, Paul. I'm writing the song I wrote. This was a this is exactly what happened. No, don't know what happened. And then in July and I'm going and I was in court, I was in a course for two months, I was in a course. This is Paul. Just listen to me. I was in a course for two months and and for leadership course this is part of the unemployment insurance go to this leadership course, they have them all over Switzerland. There's like this inner park, they call it innovation park and they have this nice building facilities with you know, two rooms for teaching and and this is complete. It's like literally. Train teaching people at a grade three level and then really pathetic and I've seen the song or anything, knew the soft that they were using like II already installed that on my laptop for the courses and stuff. I'm like, way **** out there, Paul like. Five steps ahead of most people, if not 100. Listen, so anyways, no, I'd like to just miss what's that? That's in your bipolar. Well, this is my problem. This is my problem. So I can't work with these **** So I'm moving. I'm moving that fast. You see, that's the thing, Paul, because I am bipolar is actually to my advantage. The average **** eye is like, oh, come on, I don't get, I'm working all this for free, he said. Nobody's paying me to do this. I'm working 18 **** hours a day for months on end. But I like what happened was this is, I tell you what happened, Paul. I was in that inner park course. And I brought this, Iris, I'm really excited this is going to help. And they were going to like help me become, you know, more entrepreneur and give me the no, it was pathetic. And then finally with a 1 on one coach that, you know, for your career counseling, she was pathetic. It was, it was humiliating listening to such a **** idiot because they just, you've got to find your way. And I'm like, is that what you say to everybody? It's like pretty much, you know that everybody has to like what are you doing? Like that's not hoping. It's not helping. Resume and everything. You haven't done any homework. You just you just regurgitating the same **** So after that phone call I said that's it. I'm **** doing it now and I've had enough. And So what I started doing and I developed and bang, I'm like, I've got something nobody in the world house and it's not in my **** head. Paul, trust me, you're going to **** hear about it. And if you don't, I don't care. I don't care because I know what I got. And so I'm not going to go and publicize this and I'm going to show people it's on the Internet It's in the Github. And I've already got somebody looking at and I think it's her because somebody's following my, my, my repo. And I had a funny feeling is her, because I reached out to her and I said, oh **** she said I got fired. And so I'm like, you know, she, she needs to go to the Ralph right away again. And I don't know if she knows that. Yeah, what's that? What? Issue. No, no no no. She would be I I'm she's not Swiss. No, she's Romanian, but she's II. Don't know how she got her degree or PHD in Burn, Switzerland. So you know she's been here for a while you know perfect English. You know of course Romanian and German and all **** We do have a nationwide currency increasing that will probably all partially growth Romanian. We're all partially Romanian. Were you getting back to caveman stuff? Like, let's let's stay focused here, Paul. Let's just stay focused. OK. You're talking about Albertina? Yeah, apartment was actually adopted. And So what it was is she was actually putting up for adoption. It was a Swiss woman who had OK. Listen, listen, Paul, you don't know how it works in this country. It's not based on the guy, it's based on the mother. What is your maiden name? And we're Barmettlers. And the Barmettler family goes back to 1491 or 1472. Sorry, 1472. No more in Switzerland is 1291 Okay. That's where our blood comes from, our mother. It doesn't matter what the sperm is, it's the mother that boards. Because you repeated the helper and you have Albert here. You have a channel in you, of course, of course, but I get that part. But just so you know, technically. Yeah, this is **** Don't worry about it, Paul. Everybody's **** consistent nonsense. It's nonsense. If I tell him I don't, you know my father came from him and say they all know that he's a camel and they don't care. It's like no, but I'm a bar member. Then they **** stand up and they go okay, you know? And yeah, and my mom was the oldest of 3rd and then when I say my mom was the oldest of 13 children. Then they all **** shut their **** mouths. They know. And my dad came from a family of 15 **** kids. Then they shut up again. And then they put their **** tails between their legs and say that **** guy promises **** just, you know, just leave him alone, you know? Okay, no problem. I can call you anymore if you like, next year, whatever, whatever, whatever. Yeah, tell me. I want you to be content and a piece of because I'm not. I don't want you to be all magical. Well, you know, they say that by by the. But by the 5th day or the 7th day, I'll be as calm as a cucumber. So I'll be all meted up and it all settled. See, I'm going through this. I'm going through what they call a homeostasis process now so the drugs go in and your body technically rejects it, but because you're putting it in every day, they told me and there's an old drug. Been around for a long time. This is not an experimental like 50 years. So it's they're very comfortable with it. It's great for bipolar. I'm the 7th bipolar guy that this this doctors handle and it's very rare. It's not as common as you think that everybody's bipolar they say, but it's not really like that you know it's just a little bit more rare so and I'm not a schizophrenic either. You see this is another thing we'll do or schizophrenic and there are schizophrenics, we know this but that's not my problem. I'm I do talk to myself. I'm sure you do too. Yeah, so. Yeah, so, but, but I might talk about myself, you know? But it's not like whenever leaves around, you know what I mean? Yeah, no, no, I like no, I'm comfortable. I don't hate myself. I accept who I am and I'm happy with it and everybody can say, well you're an **** I'm going fine. But you know what, you're the **** first guy to say that. So I think you're the **** There's this girl here, OK, this lady, she's about fifty six and she's actually on the same stuff I want. We're getting along like, you know, butter and jam, not like we're not having sex and nothing like that. And she says I gotta get to Italy and you know, I have this place like right in the S tip of Italy. And I said, you know, I always wanted to go down there, but I'm, you know, I don't speak the language. I don't know my way around. And I wouldn't want to just drive down to **** Sicily in my man by myself, you know. And then, you know, we have to drive back. It is a bit dangerous sometimes. And she's oh no, I know that Italian. And I said to tell you what and she said II want to get out. And I'm like, you know. I said, why, what's your promises? This is **** Swiss people. My same problem. So we get along great. And then we're having a nice chitchat last night and she just starts to dig in about, you know, about my wife and this and that. I'm like, hey, hey, I don't want to talk about that. Like, you know, stop it. And she just kept digging and digging. And then at the end, she's not at the end. Near the end she says, oh, can you hold my hand and keep it warm? And I will. I knew it. No, you keep your hands to yourself. Put him in your own **** pants. If some guy in enough we're supposed to be friends like you know, this is the idea you know, she wanted to **** I knew it. She wanted to have **** sex with me. I'm going to drove him over to **** Italy and then she's like would strip her clothes off and go come on, have it. You know I've had this **** with women before and this is the problem with women. They're kind of needy, you know what I mean? And so they look old. Here's a good looking guy, let's take it and play the game. But she **** blew it during this conversation because I told her 10 times I said well please, I wanted to talk about the subject and we were talking about music and stuff. Anywhere. And she were supposed to be talking about that. And that was the first thing I'm talking about. Let's sit down and have a smoke up. And she just had **** dating and dating and I said stop it. And then she knows you. I said, I don't talk with this. It doesn't. It's not making me joy talking about my my wife. And she kept going well, and then she goes, oh, can you hold my hand to keep it warm? Like not the, you know, to fix the knot of my hand or no, to keep it warm. And I said you just crossed the line. And Paul, listen, this is a big joke here in this country and it's all over the world. Oh, don't. Both harass the limit. No, the women are **** harassing the guys. And I taught Laura this is the girl I gave the phone to, she says. I hate the **** women because they're all **** manipulators and I that never came out of my mouth. Okay she was the one and and I know this is what's going on. So and I think and I really feel like that I don't feel good about Sylvie because she doesn't give back to me. Like I give and give him anything. I **** got nothing that was **** make me brain corrupt. Like I don't know how many **** times. You know, I had a rejuvenate myself to, to clean up the **** mess I've had to clean. No thanks. Nothing. Like I'm the bad guy, you know, like like so it's like, you know what? What's in it for me now? And I'm 62 and I can retire more. See, I could just go and start collecting my pension. No, no, no. I'm not gonna **** retire because, you know, for some stupid reason, the way the numbers were, the longer you don't take the money the way they make. So if I cash it now for some reason, I don't know what the numbers and I don't really give a **** you know what I'm saying? But I have to wait that three years. So I just go on vacation for three years. You see, Paul and I and I have my software and my back **** pocket. I can go into any **** business in the world. And I'm an SAP. And you don't know what's going on with SAP. For 10 years now, they were trying to push everybody to the cloud. They only got 39% of them to go. 61% says we don't want your **** anymore. We want to get out of SAP and SAP says no, just everything that you've been working on for 20 years and throw it all away and reinvented in the cloud and everybody says. **** way and what they got in the cloud is **** It's garbage. It's not a mature product. It's it's not it's not ready for primetime so SAP completely **** **** and now they're threatening SAP is threatening their customers that they have to **** move. I mean this is this is I know you cannot believe it I mean they'll be like you're telling your I know I can't even imagine who what company would ever threaten your own customers. I mean this this is the most bizarre thing so I might be at the right place at the right time. And I got the right software and I can walk in a large myself will run a large **** machines like million **** messages a minute, like if not a second. So it's designed that way and it's all open source and it's the best of the best of the best. It's much better. SAP is designed to be complicated. It's designed that way so they can make the money and and play their games. Listen Paul, I'm working for an espresso OK. But you know, it's an espresso, right? The coffees. Now get this, get this. Yeah, I get on the scene and it's old. Kennel, we need you over here. Help us out. I get there and go. When you guys going one. Well, we're supposed to go online like, you know, 6 months ago.
