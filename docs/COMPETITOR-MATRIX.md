## THE 420 VERDICT

For a **Swiss headshop with 40 staff, 7K+ products, CBD compliance needs, and budget consciousness**:

```
BEST FIT:        HelixNet (own it) or Odoo Community (support available)
OVERKILL:        SAP (any flavor)
TOO SIMPLE:      SumUp, Shopify POS
GOOD BACKUP:     Lightspeed (if just POS needed)
```

## DECISION MATRIX

| Criteria (Weight) | Helix | Odoo CE | Lightspeed | SAP B1 |
|-------------------|-------|---------|------------|--------|
| Cost (30%) | 10 | 8 | 7 | 3 |
| Features (25%) | 7 | 9 | 6 | 10 |
| Control (20%) | 10 | 9 | 4 | 3 |
| Support (15%) | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| ISO Ready (10%) | 5 | 8 | 3 | 10 |
| **WEIGHTED SCORE** | **8.1** | **8.2** | **5.9** | **6.2** |

**Tie-breaker:** HelixNet is already built and running. Odoo requires migration.

> *Some hats are called 'implementation fee.'*
> *Some hats are called 'per-seat license.'*
> *Tell didn't bow. Neither should you."*
