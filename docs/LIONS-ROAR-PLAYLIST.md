# THE LION'S ROAR PLAYLIST

## Pre-MTV Classics — The Backbone Between Live Bands

*"A Change Is Gonna Come" — Sam Cooke*

---

## THE CONCEPT

Between live bands at each village stage, the playlist fills the gaps.
Not random. CURATED. Songs that MEAN something.
Pre-MTV era — when music was MUSIC, not marketing.

**NO AUTO-TUNE. NO CORPORATE POP. SOUL.**
