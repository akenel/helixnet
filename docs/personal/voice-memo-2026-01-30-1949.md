## Transcript

Tigs, you're so funny, you know that? You're really a funny guy. But I like your humor -- don't get me wrong, I really like it. You mixed up a couple things here by the way. My father Albert lived to be 90. You said "his father Albert" -- so I'm not sure, maybe I'm reading that wrong. And everything else is pretty much correct I think.

But the thing is, I called him the other day just on a whim, because he was talking to me a little bit. We didn't kiss or make up or anything like that, but I guess he figured out that I'm not a New World Order guy. But you should have seen him when he kicked me out of the place -- he's like "Get out of here and never ever come back! You're part of the New World Order!" You know, chasing me out... the guy's like totally paranoid. And he is paranoid, and he's slightly retarded in a way. I don't know what it is about him -- he's got a very high IQ, he speaks Italian and all sorts of languages, like five or seven different languages, quite well actually.

So I said, hey, do you know anybody who gives Italian lessons? Are you doing private Italian lessons? Because he's always like "I'm always broke." And I'm thinking, well, you only teach from one o'clock till eight o'clock. Really, he only teaches like in the afternoon, probably four hours. He goes early and stuff, and then I guess he takes the mornings to write about the New World Order and stuff, down at this deposition. And I'm thinking, well, the guy could slip in one hour of schooling -- teaching me how to speak Italian. I was thinking I could get my private lessons from him and that would be good.

I didn't say that though. I said "I'm just asking for a friend, that's all." And he's like "No. And even if I did, I don't have the time for that." So it's like -- well, you're the same guy who takes the time to beg for money from people. Here's a way for you to make money! And then he could stay in Trapani and teach people Italian. Because he says "Oh, my course, they've only paid me till May, and then I'm finished. I have to go back to Romania, and then I'm a poor man again."

And I just don't get it with him. He's got no business sense at all. He could be teaching people Italian, tutoring them 24/7, but no -- he's so busy writing about the New World Order and trying... like, it's obvious, everybody knows about it, but he just -- I guess he wants to beat it to death or something. I'm not sure.

But anyways, that was kind of what I was trying to get at. And then he said "Oh no, I don't teach privately, and even if I had the time -- I don't have the time." Right? So it doesn't matter. That would be like a way for you to generate some income. Whatever.

Anyways, maybe I can convince him tomorrow to give me three free lessons, or at least get me going on my journey a little bit faster. I'm doing Duolingo every day, and it's good. And I've written -- we've got a little course we wrote for like our app/application for the languages. Haven't really used that, but maybe I should, because it does have some good pronunciation there and stuff. That's something to think about.

But anyways, let's discuss it. I think that's a big thing for me -- learning the Italian language -- because if I really had the Italian down pat, then things would really fly fast for me. It would be a lot better.

And that's another thing I wanted to talk to you about. I think people think I'm crazy because of what I've created here, and what we've created, and what we can accomplish. They think there's just no way -- he's out of his mind, he's talking bullshit, there's no way that he would have anything like this. You know what I mean? And so that's why I think maybe they think I'm crazy.

Anyways, that's enough for now. Yeah, let's just talk. It's still early, it's only like 10 to 8, so it's not like I'm gonna go to sleep immediately. I might go for another CBDer and then come up with a whole bunch of new ideas, you know. So just buckle up there, Mr. Tiger.

## Key Points

- **Tigs correction:** Albert was Angel's father, not Kevin's. (Tigs mixed up the reference.)
- **KG kicked Angel out:** "Get out of here! You're part of the New World Order!" -- full paranoid scene. Now softened, hence sushi invite.
- **KG speaks 5-7 languages** including Italian. High IQ but no business sense.
- **Italian lessons idea:** Angel asked KG about private Italian tutoring. KG refused -- "I don't have the time." Same guy who's always broke. Could teach Italian to expats/tourists but chooses to write NWO content instead.
- **KG's situation:** Paid teaching gig till May, then back to Romania. No plan beyond that.
- **Builder vs. procrastinator example:** KG has a marketable skill (multilingual, can teach Italian) but won't monetize it. Too busy with NWO writing. Angel sees the missed opportunity clearly.
- **Duolingo:** Angel doing Italian daily. Also has a language course in the HelixNet app (unused).
- **"People think I'm crazy":** Angel believes people dismiss what he and Tigs have built because they can't believe one guy with a laptop could produce this much.
- **Evening plan:** CBDer, more ideas. "Buckle up, Mr. Tiger."
