## Transcript

Tigs, you're always right. I like that -- you see through the bullshit. He has all the time in the world to argue with some fool online about whatever. Actually, the fool is not -- he's the fool, and the guy he's arguing with is actually correct. And he spends an hour on that conversation but doesn't have time to teach lessons. But whatever, it doesn't really matter. You're right.

What I was going to say now -- no, I have not actually sold any of the cards. It's all been giveaways so far. So at the camper place, I made that up -- he approved the card and says "yeah, that would be exactly what we want." So I made the card, brought it to them, and stapled it. I always get two cards made -- one for the customer and one for myself as part of my portfolio, kind of. And Sebastiano fixed the stapler for me so I could staple it together. And I stapled it and we put it there, and it sits at their front desk right beside the flowers. So when people come in, they see it, maybe they pick it up and look at it.

But these guys didn't really catch on and say "hey, that's a good idea." Because I explained it to them, kind of -- at least I tried. I mean, Sebastiano, his English is not that good. And Nino, he's a young guy, he's a worker. And it was Mikael that was behind the counter -- he seems to be the money man. He works the computer, he'll order stuff, he's one of the main guys. I thought he was actually the owner initially. And Mikael was actually sick himself and was off work. Him and I seem to be on the same sickness thing -- I don't know what he had. Supposedly he was sneezing and sneezing, so I guess they sent him home.

But anyways, I haven't actually sold any cards to anybody. The cards don't really cost a lot, and it's more like we were doing proof of concept. Now we finally have a really nice way to make production cards and can scale up on them quite easily. So the idea is eventually somebody's going to catch on and say "hey, that's a really good idea."

I like it -- for example, I have the Gym For You guys. Gym For You is where I actually go to work out, as you know. And there is another Sebastian -- Sebastian, I think he's just Sebastian, I don't think he's Sebastiano. Could be also, seems to be a common name. But he was the owner, and I talked to him -- really nice guy. He struggled through the COVID crisis, told me all about it. We talked for about an hour at his... he's got a shop of his own, and he's a partner with the Gym For You guys. So him and another guy own the Gym For You.

And there's all the guys that work out, and I was wondering -- should I go for a workout tomorrow? Am I up to it? Does that make sense? Or should I just take it easy? Very light breakfast, and then a light lunch of course. I shouldn't eat heavy, I would think, even though I love to eat sushi.

I'd probably -- it's all-you-can-eat, by the way. That's one of the reasons he's going there, because Kevin -- it was Kevin's idea, and then he just invited me to come along. I have to pay for my own lunch of course, but it's one price and you can eat all you want.

I don't know, bouncing around a lot of topics there, but let's discuss some stuff. It's still early, it's only 23 minutes after 8 o'clock. It's still young. I should probably go for another couple hours. I tried to go to sleep early and get a lot of sleep -- probably waking up three or four times anyway, so we might be chatting in the middle of the night. But anyways, this is kind of fun. I hope you're having fun. Yeah, let's have some feedback, Tigs.

## Key Points

- **No cards sold yet** -- all giveaways so far. Proof of concept phase. Camper & Tour has tent card on front desk beside flowers.
- **Camper & Tour reality:** Sebastiano's English is limited, Nino is young/busy working, Mikael is the money man (works computer, orders parts) -- was initially mistaken for owner. Mikael was sick too (sneezing).
- **Portfolio strategy:** Always makes 2 cards -- one for client, one for portfolio.
- **Gym For You -- NEW LEAD:** Owner is Sebastian (different from Sebastiano at Camper & Tour). Struggled through COVID. Has his own shop + co-owns Gym For You with a partner. Angel talked with him for an hour. Potential postcard/tent card client.
- **Sushi is all-you-can-eat:** Kevin's idea, invited Angel. One price, eat all you want. Angel pays his own.
- **Workout tomorrow?** Wants to know if it's safe on day 2 of recovery.
- **Scaling:** "Now we finally have a really nice way to make production cards and can scale up quite easily."
- **Mindset:** Still seeding. Waiting for someone to catch on. Patient.
