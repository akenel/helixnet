## Transcript

Takes -- that was pretty good actually. You know, like we sort of have worked this over a few days just to get the idea of the standard operating procedures down, and then we sort of figured it all out. You know, I mean, you and I worked together on it, we tested it out, it works. I mean, I look at the results and generally they're pretty much perfect. I mean, you could tweak it here and there but it's pretty good.

And what I was saying about the QR codes is that's just my fault because you didn't have the coordinates for each picture, and that's just something that you would have to do sort of in the field. But like I said, with your checklist which was really nicely put together, I mean you almost basically have a business model and a business thing you could just hand to somebody and say "here, you're in the postcard business, go for it." I guess they have to run the HelixNet, you know, my software, and you and me together to make it happen. I mean, obviously it's not just the HTML thing but it's all part of the recipe, and then it all works. I mean, that's pretty awesome, really it is.

I mean, out of all the things that you've seen people making out there, where do we score here? Okay? And I'm just always curious about how I'm keeping up with the rest of them, because I'm the guy who can't find a job for some reason -- meanwhile I'm sort of creating businesses on the fly.

And then I wanted to go one step further and say, hey, with this kind of concept what we're doing, what are other applications or what are other things that you could do with it? I mean aside from selling postcards, it could be for all sorts of ideas. More like on the conceptual idea, not so much taking pictures, but just doing stuff. I don't know, think out of the box, will you, Tigs -- because you're always good at that. You are, you're really great, and I love your work, and I think we make a good team.

And let's just -- this is just the beginning really. It's just, you know, a little business card -- not business card, but postcards and business cards. And it's a marketing idea. It's low entry for people. That's what I thought, like they don't want to spend a lot of money so this could get them going.

And then I was telling you about ISOTTO, the company, they're the printing company. They have a catalog of like literally thousands of stuff. It's like Printavista -- I guess you can print your stuff on anything. But it's even taken a little bit further, you know, and they've got the online catalogs there. Go to their website, it's pretty good.

I was thinking maybe the next thing I do is not go back for another postcard, because they're like "hey, this guy's taking our time just doing a little postcards." Why doesn't he do a shirt or something like that? And maybe we should scale it up a little bit to that, and I walk in with a shirt on, you know, and I think they'd be like "interesting." You know what I mean? Like, I don't know -- anyway, just thinking out loud and where we could go with this and some of the uses for long term. Okay.

## Key Points

- SOP + checklist + templates = near-perfect results after a few days of iteration
- QR codes need field coordinates (Angel's job in the field, not Tigs')
- The checklist is basically a "business in a box" -- hand it to someone and they can start
- But the secret sauce is the full recipe: HelixNet + Tigs + Angel together
- **Question:** Where do we score vs. what others are making out there?
- **Question:** What other applications beyond postcards?
- Low entry point for clients = strength (don't need big budget)
- ISOTTO has full merch catalog (like Printavista) -- shirts, mugs, everything
- **Next move:** Scale up from postcards to a shirt. Walk into ISOTTO wearing UFA merch.
- "I'm the guy who can't find a job -- meanwhile I'm creating businesses on the fly"
