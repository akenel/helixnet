- Uses this as his primary example of mass mind control

### 3. Anarcho-Capitalism (Berwick's Position)
- Berwick identifies as anarcho-capitalist / voluntarist

## Key Quotes

> "For years and years, every time I talk to an American... they go 'where do you live?' I go, Mexico. And they're like 'oh my gosh, isn't it dangerous?' Like, oh, you've been watching that oblong box, the scrolling mirror in your house."

> "I'm the guy who can't get on CNBC anymore because I exposed the Federal Reserve."

> "They give you the teams with the colors... you give them some colors and a symbol and a sing-along song... and you tell them that's your team, tell them the other team's bad. For most humans, that's all you really need to do."

> "The difference between 4-star and 5-star is not intelligence. It's consistency." (Not from video -- Tigs adding context for Angel)

## Why Angel Flagged This Video

Angel said this video explains "why people think I'm crazy" -- the parallel is clear:

1. **Berwick's experience:** People dismiss him because he doesn't have mainstream credentials (not on Forbes, CNBC). He's just "some crazy guy" with a laptop in Mexico making videos.

2. **Angel's experience:** People dismiss what he and Tigs have built because they can't believe one guy with a laptop in Sicily could produce this much. "People think I'm crazy because of what I've created here."

3. **The common thread:** Both are builders operating outside the system, being dismissed by people inside the system who can't see past their own programming.

The video resonated because it validates the feeling of being ahead of the curve while being called crazy for it.
