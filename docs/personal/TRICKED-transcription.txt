They kicked the door at the break
of dawn with a badge
I'm gonna have a soul that's gone
No war and no knock
Just a mask and a lie
While it gets in the wake
Can only cry over the ice
Cause I pull it's here again
Saying all the playable
Saying emotion
They're round of my best
But they screw up
Slow just a bunch of boys with
No way to go
Jeff Fandapples walked the street
Talking about the sky so neat
Whether weapons cause and stores
Globalless with secret forms
Jeff Fandapples walked there
With the flots while breathing
With hot collipses on its way
But they still find time to play
But they still find time to play
But they still find time to play
Hey, don't day apples
Oh pretty good
Nice day
Little hot and monads
Walk with the up there
I'll stick with you
Here's the house and
He come back and give me some tacos
Yeah, nice and peaceful here
Not like Minnesota
In the end of the free
Looks like anarchy up there
That's what they'll tell you
But it's actually the exact opposite
It's the government of the state
Causing massive massive chaos
Just never never ends
And the latest one is
And I don't know all the details
I didn't even really look into it that much
Like there's a vent after
And this is what I said
We're only like three weeks into 20 to 26
There's already been so many
That's in the apocalypse
You don't even have time to even look into these things
And you know
Really like
It doesn't really matter
Because when you understand what's actually going on
None of this stuff
Like the details of it doesn't matter that much
But of course you got ice out there
And they're in that super dangerous place
Minnesota where there was all those problems
And another person got shot by ice
Of course there was the René good one
Three times in the face
For pulling off
And this one
And again like I said I haven't looked at all the details
But it looks like a guy with a camera
Oh shit
What the fuck
They don't like
You fucking kidding me dude
Of course he just got his camera
And then all of a sudden the Gestapo
Start surrounding him
Start pushing him
They eventually get him on the ground
Because he had a camera
And if you look into the video
It looks like he has a gun
Cut on his waistband in the back
And you can actually see an ice agent take it
And here's where I'm not sure
It might have gone off when the ice agent took it
Although I don't know and I haven't looked into it
I don't care
But I'm just pointing this out as how it looked for what I saw
And then another ice agent just starts unloading into him
Like numerous periods times
How many shots but it looks like five shots or something
Which is pretty insane
But that's how they're trained
A lot of them are trained in Israel
If there's a gun shot you just start unloading
And so that guy's dead
And of course a lot of people
This got a lot of people all up in arms
And you actually have the right side people
Getting all upset that he had a gun
I'll give you this at a second
This is so incredible how they twist everything
They've left on the right side people are all under mine control
And in a cult
They're both in their different cults of stateism
And they flipped it all around
So now the right side people go crazy if you have a gun
And the left side people say no it's okay to have a gun
It's crazy I'll give you that more in a second
And pretty incredible to see again how
The state, the government
Kind of like puts out their angle on it
Like you have that bovino guy
Who actually dresses up like an SS officer from the Gustavo in Germany
Which the ice people are getting so mad
The people keep calling them Gustavo
It's like well you actually dress like that
And of course there's no courts or trials
Or you know things to get to the bottom of anything anymore
Now there's just tweets and press conferences
And it's like
And here's Bovino and he's like he was trying to do mass mass
Maximum damage and massacre law enforcement
The suspect also had two loaded magazines and no accessible ID
This looks like a situation
Where an individual wanted to do maximum damage
And massacre law enforcement
And of course all this stuff is all scripted for them from the producers
The directors, the main actors
We write the screenplay
Where the directors, where the producers
Where the main actors
And the world is our stage
Just like during the co-maids
With every
Mainstream media news
Outlet CIA propaganda
All's reading from the exact same script
Extremely dangerous to our democracy
This is extremely dangerous to our democracy
This is extremely dangerous to our democracy
This is extremely dangerous to our democracy
And the exact same thing here
Here's Bovino and Christy Noem
Saying the exact same things
An individual approached the US court to patrol officers
With the nine milineer, semi-automatic handgun
The officers attempted to disarm the individual
But the arms suspect reacted violently
Fearing for life and for the lives of his fellow officers
More easily fire defensive shots
Medics were on the scene immediately
And attempted to deliver medical aid to the subject
But he was pronounced dead at the scene
The suspect also had two magazines with him
He mentioned in them and the crowd got lost
He also had no idea
This looks like the situation
Individual arrived at the scene
It's like a massive damage on individuals
And it's a massive alarm
I remember reading the book
1984 by George R. Well when I was younger
And it seemed like such a fantasy
Like because that wasn't how my world appeared
It was actually
But now it's so, so obvious
The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears
It was their final, most essential command
Same with that René, good one
They're like, oh she was trying to kill everybody
Didn't look that way at all
This guy had a camera
Now he did have a gun
And we'll get into that a second
But it's the land of the free I thought
You're actually supposed to be allowed to have a gun
That appears to be a change in the narrative now
And I'll get into that in a second
As I mentioned, yeah that Bovino guy
He dresses like pretty close to an SS officer
From Germany
From the Gestapo
And I think I'm going to get like a much lower credit score
On X after this video
Because
Calling all enforcement names like Gestapo
Or using the term kidnapping
That is a choice
That is made their actions and consequences
That come from those choices
And then when you choose
When someone chooses to listen
To a politician, a so-called journalist, a community leader
That's spouted that type of
Billification towards law enforcement or anything
Else when you choose to listen to that
That is a choice in their consequences and actions
They're also
I think we saw that yesterday
So let me get this straight
So if you use words they have consequences
That's true
That's true
See there's always a little bit of truth
He says by using names like Gestapo
Or calling it kidnapping
You're going to have some consequences
Well, I'm glad I'm not in the US
Because I probably wouldn't have some consequences
Luckily I'm here in Mexico
We do have a Jewish president
But they don't have any power or control of anything
Which they want to change
That's what the whole attack on the cartel stuff is
But yeah, this whole video is about how ISIS Gestapo
And I always call a kidnapping
Whenever the government takes someone and puts them
And takes them from anywhere
By force and puts them in a cage
Because what is that?
That is kidnapping
I just use words
That describe what's actually happening
What's interesting, you point out
You can't call them Gestapo
Most Americans won't even know
What the actual meaning of that word is
They'll just have known the word
From numerous Hollywood movies about the Holocaust
Which never happened
You see how insane all this stuff is?
It's all lies all propaganda
But here is what the word Gestapo actually means
It's from German
It literally means secret state police
It comes from the abbreviation of the full German name
Gahem Stas Polizai
Gahem Secret Stas State
Polizai Police
Gestapo
The capitals were taken to form the short name Gestapo
Okay, so I mean secret government state police
What is ice?
Well, it's government state police
Kind of, they're not really police
But they act like military basically in the streets
Now the secret part
How many of these ice people just can do anything they want
There's hidden detention centers
All that kind of stuff
Sounds kind of secret to me
So that's just the German word
For what ice is
But I guess there's gonna be some consequences for me saying that
Well, I've gotten used to that
And I don't mind
Because you know what the consequences that matter to me are
That I always say what is correct and true
As much as I can
Like with the best of my ability
With the best of my knowledge
And what is right
Despite the consequences
And that's something a lot more people need to do
But it's so incredible again
Like for years and years
Every time I talk to an American
Or even other people from other countries
Because they all get the same propaganda
And they go, where do you live? I go, Mexico
And they're like, oh my gosh, isn't it dangerous?
Like, oh if even watching that that oblong box
The scrolling mirror in your house
They're like, yeah, look at it
I peer into it for hours a day
It's like, oh, you're under the mind control
Yeah, no, it's not that dangerous
It's actually one of them
Like for me
Like really
Like how long have I been here like 15, 20 years now?
Never had a problem
I've tried to beat up some cops sometimes
So that was my old life where I was drinking a lot
And I'd end up in jail
And then I'd pay my way out and all that kind of stuff
But as far as problems that come to me
Now of course there's problems that happen in life
Not normal
But as far as Mexico and general being dangerous
I'd say the US
Like, how can you watch all this stuff?
I've actually seen the World Cup
Which is their sportsball distraction
Obviously, which actually the World Cup guy
Even just said recently
It's basically magic to basically keep people
Dossled
Because this
Is also magic
You would think this is a ball, right?
Well, that's not a ball
This is not a ball
This is actually
Let me show you
Well, you see
This is a magic instrument
That transforms people
In happy people
Again
Look how smiling you see
Immediately
It was serious
It gets a ball around
A little bit to the crowd
And you will see
Transforms people in happy
People
This is what this strange instrument does
And children
The children's face become happy
And adults become children
They start playing past in the ball
Look the smiles all over the room
This is fantastic
This is beautiful
So that's coming up in like June or something
And it's actually in three different countries
Canada, the US and Mexico
And I might even go to a game
Here in Mexico
Like a team Mexico game
Even though they kind of suck
And even though it's super, super boring to me
Like I can't believe
Anyone can sit through a soccer game
Like once you watch hockey your whole life
It's just like don't don't
Guys even just touch someone
And just flop around
And cry
And then another guy comes in
And gives him a yellow
And never goes
And then they usually decide it
By kicking a small ball into a giant net
That the goalkeeper has no chance on getting
Unless he's super lucky
And then if he's super lucky
People in that country will probably kill the person
Who didn't get the goal
It's insane
But I might go to one
Just you know World Cup, Mexico
It's in Mexico
But I've seen a lot of people
Cancelling their tickets to the World Cup in the US
Because it's just far too dangerous
Which is kind of funny right?
Like a lot of them strike out of the gates of Mexico
Canada is like
Dangerous as well
Like super dangerous is super poor
So that's interesting
But getting back to the ice Gustavo
There actually isn't really a lot of difference
And how it all looks
From the Gustavo
But let's you know
Look at them both and make sure
No ice is not just like the Gustavo
See there are some differences
Let's go through the differences between the Gustavo and the ice
Private army serving one man
Okay, same
Purpose is to facilitate ethnic cleansing
Kind of although it's all people
Except all goyum basically
Same
Dress an intimidating clothing
Well, they're actually the Gustavo
Dressed super nice
Like I kind of wish it was like that
Now it's like these Robo
Military Robo cops
Send out to terrorized neighborhoods
Yeah, they both kind of did that
Randomly kidnapped innocent people
Yep both
Often do not carry search words
Yep both
Do not allow their victims of fair trial
I don't think there's any trials going on
No
Send their victims to the concentration camps
Looks like that's what's happening
Oh, here's the difference
The Gustavo did not hide their faces behind mass
And
In the case of
Germany the public was too afraid to fight back
But in the US
Here's where I have a problem with this meme
I'd say the US they're too afraid to fight back too
Because you haven't really seen that have you
Like you have a criminal organization
That did 9-11
That fake the moon landing
That's
Created a
Plandemic
We're no virus existed
And they tried to kill everyone in the US
They steal about half of everyone's money
They tell you you can't do anything
Like there's more rules and laws in the US
I'll have to look this up but there's got to be the anywhere else on earth
Land of the free
So what are the people waiting for to stand up to the government
They all have guns
This is the really interesting thing
Is they actually have the ability
to fight back but they don't
Because they're too scared
And on the SS side
I don't know because I wasn't there
But it's not all how people think it was I don't think
Like basically you have basically
Judea Jewish culture
Whatever you want to call it
Had declared war on Germany
So Germany with their government and all of it
Learn all that so we gotta get these people out
They tried to transfer them through
I think Madagascar
But through the Rothschilds
They did the ball force sort of thing
And they ended up sending them to Palestine
Which is to this very day
The most horrible place on earth
Because of the people who moved in there
So when you hear about like the SS and stuff
I think they did have them
And I think they probably did some doze quite a bit of bad stuff
Like sort of like ice officer
Just going around harassing people
You know papers please sound familiar
It's basically it's almost exactly the same
Although if you're really kind of like look back
And how a lot of that SS stuff was
It was way way way better
It was way worse civilized
It was still like a lot of
Tyranny and a lot of
That sort of a thing
From what I can tell
But I look nothing like this
This ice stuff looks like the most heinous like
Just brutal dictatorship
Ever coming in and just stomping on people
Whereas in Germany
It looked like way more civilized actually
Although
Now they're kind of like looking similar
But the US looks far far far worse
So
Nazi
Nazi
Nazi
Peter
Have you seen me as Nazi?
I don't know, it's a different type
Just because I've been in the STP
And it's been a long time
No Nazi
Maybe I'm still a real extreme or something
But I'm not really a real Nazi
But I'm not a real Nazi
And I'm a real Nazi
Hey, see you
I'm just a Nazi
I'm not a Nazi
I'm not a Nazi
I'm not a Nazi
But it's probably also a Nazi
Nazi
Nazi is Nazi
It's a Nazi
Then
He's a Nazi
He's not a Nazi
He's a Nazi
He's a Nazi
He's a Nazi
He's a Nazi
But Nazi is a mainstream
He's a Nazi
I'm a Nazi
In your world
The Führer is probably a Nazi
But
Yes
I'm a Nazi
I'm a Nazi
I'm a Nazi
I think based on that
If you're going to say
Would your rather live
During the times of Nazi Germany
You're living the US right now?
Based on everything I know
Easily
Easily Nazi Germany
Like, yeah
They had a bunch of like state stuff
Government stuff
Not for it at all
But like so much better than this
Here's Minneapolis
Not Fallujah
And that means remind you
The reason we're talking about Fallujah
Because the US went in there
And killed
500
Because they've also done it in Gaza
There's very legitimate reports now
That over 500,000 children
have been killed in Palestine
In the last two years
And they did the same thing
And Iraq
But you know
They thought it was worth it
We have heard that half a million children have died
I mean that's more
Children than died in Hiroshima
And you know
Is the price worth it
I think this is a very hard choice
But the price we think the price is worth it
And then even in that video
Like this US terrorist organization
Do you get it yet?
She's like
Well, this is as bad as when the US killed
Almost everyone in two different
Japanese cities for no reason
It's like
They keep comparing
The past terrorist acts
To their latest ones
It's like wasn't as bad as last one
It's like can we just stop this
But the people are under the mine control
They've watched thousands of Hollywood movies
About how the military is out there
Team America world police
I got him
I got him
I got him
I got him
I got him
I got him
I got him
I got him
I got him
I got him
I got him
I got him
I got him
I got him
I got him
I got him
I got him
I got him
But really all this is just so sad
Because all these people are just under mass of mass of mine control
And they've been fooled and tricked into
Cheering on a lot of people cheer on this journey
Like as an example
Like I got
Like you hear a lot of these sort of
Maga people and even non-Maga people
Sort of like a lot of American people saying stuff like
Well the immigrant stuff has gotten so bad
Which actually it really hadn't gotten that bad
You know a lot of it's just a bunch of Mexican people
Who just do your gardening
Like in fact that that's causing a ton of problems now
Because a lot of them are leaving
And people there's just no workers to do this
Of course that's what the robots are for
And that's a whole different story
And I've said to Mexicans for a long time
Like do not go to the US
It's the most
One of the most horrible places on earth
And they're seeing that now
Like they're getting chased down the streets of being hunted
What are you doing?
Like Maga is still here
And actually the economy is probably like better
Many ways than the US
But I think a lot of them are figuring that out now
But you know there has been some problems
Like for example
David avocado wolf told me that there's an area of Texas
Where
Basically
There was some sort of like what you could call immigrants
Or what he called cartel or those sort of people
He was using massive chaos in these Texan border towns
So he was kind of like pro this Trump stuff
Because I think it's father lives there
So things like we got to get rid of these people
Well here's the thing here's the trap
And here's the sad part
All of that stuff is caused by the government
Basically on purpose
To make you want the police state
And so that's where the sad part comes in
Is that they're so good at what they do
And people can't see it
They're like no Biden brought it
And Trump before him
Yeah
Yeah
They all do
It's all one big
System a criminal system
But they do these things
So they bring in all these migrants
So cause problems in certain areas
So that people demand the government do something
The Galilean dialectic
They do it over and over and over again
And that's the part that I wish
That a lot of those sort of people can figure out a little bit
Because I get it
They're like well there's my dad's like living in a war zone
Because of migrants in this sort of a thing
Yeah that's terrible
But at least realize real eyes
That's not on purpose
To make you want to get enslaved even more
That's really the case
But in the meantime
They have all these people under mine control
And so even when the ice people go out and kill people
They become like rich
The easiest way to become a millionaire in the US
Is to shoot an innocent mother in the face
Yeah that guy is raised like a million dollars now
For being like a sapo and like shooting people in the face
That's how
See it's all just screwed up
So you might be saying like what's the answer?
There's no answer
This all needs to collapse and go down
And a lot of people are probably going to die in the process
And then we rebuild
That's the answer
And you just need to survive it
And I've been trying to tell you how to do that for a long time
If you think about it like what I'm saying
I'm saying get out of the sea
He's got out of the west
There's probably people in the sun right now
God can't even leave their house without fear and getting shot
Get on something like a ranch
And of course it doesn't have to be expensive
You can find like a super cheap place somewhere in Latin America
And grow your own food
Yeah but then Jeff I wouldn't have my car
And go to the sportsball games and all this time
It's like yeah you have to actually give up
All those things and they give you those things to keep you in their trap
And I get it like I don't want NHL hockey to go away right now
I want to see who I want to swim this family cup
But if it does I'm okay with it totally okay with it
And I realize it's all part of a system to keep people enslaved
But for me being outside of the matrix I can enjoy watching hockey game
Because it's a great game way better in soccer
Like anyone who's a big fan of soccer
Actually I keep asking Gary like because he's actually a fan of soccer
And hockey I'm like how's that possible
Those are like two opposite things
You're like being a fan of like
I don't know like skydiving and like knitting
And they're both you love them both
It's like how like how are you that kind of person it can do both those things
Anyway that wasn't a good example
I'm sure there's a better one
Anyway
And so incredible so the guy got shot by ice
He only had was a camera
He did have a gun so
So what?
Good. Everyone should have a gun
If everyone in the world had a gun it'd be a lot better
Way better. They'd be hardly any real crime
The problem is when the government has all the guns then it's just not stop crime
And that's what ice is
We have the people in the red hats
The first amendment
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion
or premoning the free exercise there of
Or a bridge in the freedom of speech
And the mega people are like I love it
Freedom of speech
Cool. I'm gonna film ice. That's terrorism
You know when I first started talking
With the dollar vigilante
Which is the first really outwardly an arco capitalist
Financial newsletter which is incredibly well
Incredible
Incredible. Well
That kind of three dollars
Till everything that we have in our portfolios at all
Time-hizer now and skyrocketing
But we started in 2010
Raid after that I started an anarchist
I have to do that to a couple years later
Started in our copoko. Let's talk about how anarchism
Basically a way of living life where people aren't slaves
And have a ruling class of violent thieving ruling class
Would be better for humanity
For years and years so many people
Just thought I was crazy because they're under the mine control
Which you know
Like I don't take it personally because I'm basically
I'm talking to people who are under heavy mine control
And like you're crazy it's like
You're under mine control
Like it doesn't matter what you think
About me because you're under mine control
But it's getting very, very obvious now
It's going to be very interesting
How things work out over the next few years
I think people are starting to get it
But they still got their teams right that's the thing
And they're so smart with it
They give you the teams with the colors
This is all very important
Humans are pretty
Still pretty kind of like basic
Like tribal basic
You give them some colors and a symbol
And like a sing along song
And
And
You tell them that's your team
They tell them the other teams bad
For most humans that's all you really need to do
So they're still stuck in it
And they're all fighting each other
When the actual problem
Is the government itself
Which
But they're like well it just needs to be us controlling it
No
And that will never work
And the reason I won't work
Like work you know what does that mean
It'll never have a really good
Outcome for the majority of humans
Because it's based on violence and theft
And anything that's based on
Anything that's basically a moral
Or not right
We'll always evolve
And to just
Hainus horrible things
Because that's the basis of it
If you base anything off of
Stealing, extorting, raping, killing, murdering
It's not going to go great for everybody
If I go great for a few people
And that's the politicians
And the people who control them
They do great
But
So basically I'm this guy
You got the left side people
With their surgeons mass for no reason
Their gay pride stuff
Now you got the red hat people
With their Israel
Which is all a raw child terrorist organization
And their military state
Police back the blue
You're both just awful
But they're so good at what they do
Basically the controllers
You know the people who
Produced
Direct act
Where the directors, where the producers
Where the main actors
The world is our stage
They're so good at what they do
And there's always so many agendas with all these things
Like every single one has so many agendas
And this particular ice one
One of the agendas
And this is becoming very obvious now
Is
A gun control agenda
Because theoretically
There's a piece of paper somewhere
And some old Mason guys
Signed it one day
And on it it says you're allowed to have a gun
Now for me personally
If someone came out and said
I got a piece of paper
Says you're allowed to have a gun
I'm like who the fuck are you
You don't tell me what
I'm allowed to do or not
You got it? That's step one
But a lot of people men all
The government's here
I've checked this and they make
Give us the rights
You have the rights
You always have the rights
That's why they called rights
The rights
But they fooled everyone
If there's criminal-thieving terrorist
Organization
It allows me to have it
Well they're quickly changing that
And this is where it's so incredible to watch
You're actually seeing the right side people
Basically wanting gun control now
Here's Donald Trump
He had a gun
Only criminals carry guns on our streets
We need law and order
Just like that television program
We're in Pupon India
Thank you for your attention this matter
There you go
That's the press
Now remember see a lot of people have forgotten
There's all the mega people
Do you guys not know Donald Trump
You used to be a Democrat
And he used to be four things like gun control
Yeah, see Donald Trump is an actor
And he has no principles
And he'll just say whatever he's told to say
But yeah, he used to be a Democrat
He's good friends with the Clintons
To mega people
Know this
And now he's basically saying
That if you have a gun
Basically that's a bad thing
And that only criminals carry guns on streets
It's not only criminals
But there is a lot of criminals, yes
Got the cops, you got the ice people
Those are all the criminals with the guns
I remember when Republicans told us it was our constitutional right to carry firearms to a place
Constitutional right to carry firearms to a protest
Now it's a problem
Open carry is bad now
And just like that
The left became pro gun
And the right became anti gun
They did it
They are so good what they did
You have to get them props
Like so so good
And they just play with everyone like puppets
And they make them do the opposite thing of what they did the last time
And in some ways
This is how this 3D video game works
If you have a bad
Basically position
The 3D video game will come and show it to you like a mirror
And that's what this is actually doing right now
So now you have the right side people
They're like kind of against guns now
So basically what the 3D video game is showing them is
But you said you said the exact opposite
Two years ago do you see
You're basically you got to get your minds hurt
You actually have to get some principles and stick to them
And that's what like anarchists are
Like anarcho capitalists, anarchists, volunteers
We just have one principle
It's like the easiest, most simple thing to stick to
Do not use force against
People who aren't using force against you
Do not
Aggress against
Innocent people
That's our only principle
It should be the easiest club to be in in the world
It's not even a club
That's how it's supposed to be
And so when things like this happen
It's very easy for us
That's wrong
There's a bunch of guys with guns wet
And like shot that guy because he had a gun
Well with the guy going to shoot them
Well of course the gun will say yes
But it looks like that did it
So again for an anarchist is very easy
We don't have to flip flop on anything
And if we do then everyone knows
We're not our true anarchist
And that's actually what you see actually
Like even with the Trump stuff
There was a whole bunch of libertarians for Trump sort of thing
Remember I laughed and laughed about that
And us real anarchists true anarchists
We're always very cautious with people
Who say that they're kind of libertarian or anarchist
Because a lot of people will say that when it suits them
So if you have a company and the regulations
Or destroying your company
You'll become libertarian for a while
So yeah libertarian shouldn't be that regulation
Because it affects you
But then it goes to regulate something else
That you don't like that you want
That isn't hurting anyone
But that you want to have problems
And then they like it
See those are basically fake libertarians
That's what most of these people are
And because of it
The cognitive dissonance
They just keep flip flopping
And whatever suits their mind control
And their feels
They'll just jump on the other bandwagon
Now here was the founding of the US which was actually a violent revolution
Quit defending dangerous criminals
Here's what the mega people would be like in Tiam and Square
Stop, stop, stop obstructing law enforcement
Here's Martin Luther King
He's an antifa agitator lock him up
Mega guy with his pound tear shirt on
And again looking back at the
Way the US was founded with a violent revolution
Armed protest totally unamerican
Yeah, here was 2024
States rights don't trend on me
2025
Occupy me with the military daddy
Click that boot
So that's one of the agendas is getting the right side to want gun control now
And the left side actually support guns
Just gotta show them how defended they all are
Trying to wake them up
Like the actual
You know in the city video game a lot of this evil stuff is there to wake people up
That's what I think
But a lot of them aren't waking up
And there's so many other agendas
They've got like 20 agendas with everything
And one of them is to roll out their palentier sort of
Database tracking sort of stuff
Which if you would have said
Barack Obama was doing that
20 years ago Alex Jones
His head would have exploded
Barack Obama's
Using like AI
Massive system to track and database
Absolutely everyone exactly what they do
What their track their eyes how they walk
No exactly where everyone is at all times
But now they managed to switch it
So people like Alex Jones now Alex Jones works for them
So he just does this that's part of his job
But a lot of people
Who used to believe in that kind of stuff
Are all actually cheering it on now
And one ice guy actually just came right out and said what they're doing
Is that illegal to record
Exactly
Yeah
That's what we're doing
Yeah why are you taking my information down
Because we have a nice little database
Oh good
We're video jumping you
Are you crazy?
Yeah if you're out there against the government
You're in a database now
Now that
The current government might not come after
Use specifically at the moment
But they're going to switch it soon to the other side
And then that comes after you
And people are going to get the boot
Forever and never
Until they wake up
And a lot of them aren't going to wake up
Then we told them
We had to put them in a domestic terrorist database
To save them from the immigration crisis we created
They're all laughing
Meanwhile here'll be the mega people a year or two for now
We sure own the lips
LOL
Oh, base, stay in line, submit
All right, he's just building a domestic terrorist database for American
I voted for this
Yeah, just as freedom
Stupid bitches should have complied
Ah, I really don't care about this
I care more about this, look at this
You've got new baby sheep
This is what I care about
Let's see if I can zoom in on him
Oh, this is so cute
That's yeah, that's more of what I care about
Oh, it's making about Jones
They've got all their CIA, Masonic
Social media influencers
Oh, I've got massively pumped up
All of us people, basically anyone who speaks of Narcopoco
We are so massively shadowmen
No one ever sees our stuff, it's incredible
Yeah, people like Alex Jones out there
Basically trying to incite the civil war
Which is another part of what they want
They've been trying to get this going for a while
The biggest problem is most Americans are too fat and lazy
To want to get out and do the civil war
But they keep trying to push him
Sorry, but welcome to America
2026
Second amendment is the only thing that's going to keep you fucking protected
From literal fucking Nazi gunmen
That are killing innocent people
In the street with impunity
This is not a fucking joke
There's nothing fun to chance about it
Get your fucking guns
And stop these fucking people
Yeah, that's what they want
And if they can get people to do it
Then they can really bring in their martial law police state to crack down
Let's go over to a turning point USA
Which was taken over by Erica Kirk
And basically the Jews
Let's see how they feel about what's going on with the ice stuff
You know from a Christian perspective
One of the videos that came into that chat
Awkwardly enough
Was a clip of Rachel Matau
And Jimmy Kimway came in police saying their names in a church
But together
But it was interesting because he asked her the question
Do you think these protests are helping?
Personally, I do not think it's demonic
Yeah, the inversion is so incredible
You're demonic if you stand up to a tyrannical police state
Good, you know, that's what the
Jesus would just say
You know, you got to support the tyrannical police state
It's not incredible, everything is so inverted
Meanwhile, they wrapped up in Davos
Which Trump of course was the big part of
You know, a lot of people are like, I just got to get rid of
Clive Schwab and World Agam before
No
Elon Musk was there too
Remember when Elon said he declined a weapon
And everyone cheered saying Elon is an anti-globalist
Elon is on our side
Well, this year
Conversation with Elon Musk
Yeah, he just went there to kind of like
Make jokes about the new world order
Police state that all of them are involved in
I mean, I heard about the formation of the peace summit
And I was like, is that P.I. E.C.
You know, little peace, Greenland, a little peace
Thanks very much
We got one
All we want is peace
Yeah, just talking about a little bit of peace
A great land, peace of Columbia
But I feel like I've heard that somewhere before
I don't want more
All I want is peace
Peace
Peace
All it took me so cold
And it took me so cold
And it took me so cold
And it took me so cold
And all that peace of Columbia
And all that peace of Columbia
And all that peace of Columbia
And a big part of what they always do
Is as they're causing all this chaos
They push through all kinds of stuff
So that people don't pay attention
It's incredible how they do it
And one of the most recent ones
Was the US government now wants to put a kill switch
Very interesting term
Into every automobile
Specifically the electronic vehicles
And of course, this will all be part of Palantir
This will all be part of the police state
If you say something about it, but as real
All of a sudden your car will just drive you right to the concentration camp
And this is like
It's going to be so
So incredible
That now if you like even mention the Jews
And say anything bad about them
That you're going to go to the concentration camp
In your Tesla EV vehicle
And the doors will be locked, you won't be able to get out
And if you try to get out
The car will blow up the battery
This is incredible
Who wrote this script?
This is the best 30 video game of all time
But yeah
Then you have Thomas Massey
Who
He's one of the only people in Congress
Who's even close to being a true libertarian
He seems mostly libertarian
Now he's controlled opposition
He's been put into place
He's sort of like a watered down Ron Paul
And he went to I think
Masonic or Jesuit school
Anyway, he's the controlled opposition
Libertarian in Congress
And here he is basically saying that
He stood up to the bill
But unfortunately, he couldn't get it
Stoff
He tried so hard
He couldn't
A government kill switch in every car
There's this one I voted for
Of course, Massey's been one of the only people
Still trying to get some of this
Epstein stuff out
And here's Trump
His, you know, alter ego
On the on the stage talking about Massey
You know, guy like this loser
Massey, he's a real loser
Some psychiatrist ought to go see
Even a really great point
They just vote no, I don't know what it is
I think they think they get good publicity
They really don't they hurt the country
Meanwhile, the other alternative media influencers
Who are all controlled, massage and CIA operatives
Like Nick Fuentes
It's so incredible
Because he kind of like came out and said
He was against Israel hell before
And now he's basically for all this sort of stuff
And he's even come out recently
And said that Jeffrey Epstein was awesome
Epstein's my boy dude
Let's just be honest, Epstein was cool as fuck
There I said it
What are you going to do?
Go ahead, cancel me
Yeah, I said it
Jeffrey Epstein was cool as fuck
Now what? Go ahead, cancel me, do it
And now he's coming out
And he's selling Jeffrey Epstein sort of merch
We also have our
USA Quarter Zip
We have our brand new custom high quality
USA Quarter Zip
It has a big USA logo on the front
And an American flag patch on the side
This is great
Just in time for spring
You know when the weather starts to warm
up a little bit
Perfect for the spring
Throw this on
And let everybody know
You're an American Patriot
Let everybody know that you're a USA
Patriot, check it out
This is a great
I'm told that a lot of people love this style
It's very hot right now
Very trendy
I love the ice stuff
Drumroll place
Insurrection Act now
They have Laura Lumer
I'm a South Asian
It's time for President Trump
Timberman at the Insurrection Act
and start a Civil War in Minnesota
Then you have a little George Costanta
Timmy pool who's also a massage agent now
Trump needed to invoke the Insurrection Act a long time ago
Notice a lot of these
More right wing they call them now
You know Timples like a left guy
But he switched to the right because
That's what he got paid to do
And notice a lot of the
They're all like we need like a strong government
to come in here and crack down
Notice they're all the most of feminine
Little losers
Nick Fuente is himself he's like gay
Nick, you're not straight by your definition
Because you've never engaged in the action
of heterosexual intercourse
It's true
I'm a sexual
I'm an asexual
You can't get out of this one
Because you know you can't get out of this
It's not a joke
Wait so Nick you're not straight
Not yet
You can never be too careful these days
Everybody's transgender
Everything is transgender
You can never be too sure
I will take one for the team
I will conduct the body inspection
We're professionals
We're not going to be weird about it
We're going to be professional
Okay
This is where we are in 2025
You know
This is the world we live
And we need to have transvestigation units
I will volunteer
I will take a look
Under the hood
They got Tim Poole
If he ever takes off his beanie
He looks just like George Costanza
And they're all calling for
You know
The boot to come down on certain people
It's incredible
It's so incredible
Meanwhile at the World Economic Forum
You had Mike Huckabee who's like the
Diplomat to Israel
And he showed up with
Basically
Not quite a block-eye
But like a red eye
Well there was a letter that was put out
By the more liturgical churches
The non-evenshellicals
Catholic
Recorthodox Russian Orthodox
A host
I think there's about ten different denominations
And they said that they're the only ones
Who can speak for Christians in the Holy Land
You had McRone who had the same thing
So he wore sunglasses the whole time
The thing squiggles in through the eye
It does a spiral around the optic nerve
All the way to a certain point
And it's driven there by taste
And they said once it gets there
It has the taste of butter scotch
It then starts what if they call
Sweating the quilt
The spinal cord stuff comes out of spinal cord
And it's everything that the lizard is
The lizard's old body is dead
And it can't go back in
It's one way
The juice that's in the spinal cord
It's excreted out of the tip of this thing
Their parasitic cells
The parasitic cells go into the brain
The old person's consciousness is gone
The body is absolutely totally dominated
And the lizard is smarter
As a human over time
It'll develop a rash
It'll lose tear
Then you notice
Almost every public figure ever
Has had a black left eye usually
Someone posted this
Two men that completely changed after getting a black eye in 2025
What a coincidence
Here's the thing
They didn't change at all
They've been on that side since the get go
But people didn't realize
That
And then they might have got the black eye
That actually just gets them deeper into the cult
Now they're not even
They're not really human anymore after that
They become basically like true lizard people
And they're completely in the cult after that
They might have been like 90% before 80%
And just like wanting to like get like their black eye
So they can get the thing
So that they can become lizard people
That's actually what they do
And all those people have all the views
On things like acts by the way
Meanwhile people like anyone
It speaks at Narkbuck on my self-maxe
Against the Peters
Where usually men, blocks, shadow band
Garth eye, David eye
It's incredible
And meanwhile
At Davos
Here was one of the biggest sponsors of Davos, by the way
And the most poignant photo of Davos goes to
The giant is not even a booth
You know when you're a sponsor or something
Usually of a booth
They have an entire building for Palantir
Meanwhile on stage
The Coke addict
Gay comedian
Actor
From Ukraine
Who's not like a billionaire
Zelensky
Was on stage called for the exact same thing
So they're all at the world like in my forum
And they're all called for the same thing
Elon Musk Donald Trump
And Zelensky
We need a new world order
But where is the line of leaders who are ready to act?
Act now
On land in the air
They see to build a new global order
You can't build a new world order
Out of words
Only extra straight real order
Meanwhile they are well and stuff
Continues on with
Trump at Davos all week
And they actually did a board of peace
Remember or well
War is peace
And you never guess who's got a senior position on the word of peace
Benjamin Millikowski
Who's been doing a massive genocide
And talking, I don't know how many countries
Got to be like five right now
He's a senior position on the board of peace
Very interesting
And they say that you had to pay a billion dollars
To be on the word of peace
And that Millik another Jew
From Argentina
Who just received forty billion dollars from the US
Where did Argentina get the billion dollars to join Trump's board of peace
From Trump
Actually from the US people it was all stolen from
Meanwhile while Trump was signing the board of peace charter in Davos
Israel was literally bombing civilian targets in Lebanon
Beyond parity
It is
And also at the same time they're doing their board of peace
Breaking
Israel is currently invading and desecrating the Church of the Nativity and Bethlehem Palestine
This is one of the oldest Christian churches on earth
Wow
They were sure busy bombing places while they were signing their
Sitting down for their press conference with the board of peace
We're not going to do anything
Once this board is completely formed we can do pretty much whatever we wanted to
Yeah, and Trump just got the Nobel Peace Prize that Machado gave to him
While they're doing all these massive wars
You couldn't make this stuff up
Oh, breaking news is going to wolf blitz in a situation where what's going on wolf
Yes, Jeff Jeff's in
Millie Vanilli have just given Donald Trump their Grammy
Wow, what an accomplishment
Congratulations to
El Fuer
I mean why you have that little Jared Kushner guy
He's all over the place he was actually in Russia during all this
And he's been doing so much of this stuff
And of course anyone I guess
Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu both agree that such an agreement would not have passed
If not for the involvement of Jared Kushner
Kushner who holds no official position in Trump's first term
It was Jared Kushner who came out of nowhere and started to broker Middle East peace deals
It was Kushner who developed the Abraham Accords deal
It was Kushner who helped to set up the US embassy in Jerusalem exactly 70 years on its anniversary
It was Kushner who just recently, even though he holds no official White House position, instituted a major Israel deal between nations this term
And it was Kushner who advised this administration on what could happen
If Gaza was a vacated and then rebuilt
And now we see he is making plans to turn Gaza into an AI-driven smart city with his project sunrise planned
Now that the war is over, if you want to integrate Israel with the broader Middle East
You have to help the Palestinian people thrive and do better
We're just getting started
Things just work out when he is involved
Which is why he is now back into the picture
Can I reveal Jared how long we've known you?
He was never small, he was always big
He was always tall, but I'm Jared Kushner
Well let's just say he is someone to keep your eyes on
It was also a Kushner who made history with one of the largest real estate purchases
When he acquired the six six six building as his company's office
And of course what a coincidence there, you know six six six
Right, of course that would just have to be one of the largest purchases in the United States
The six six six building by Jared Kushner
And then you have people making the point that his name translates into six six six
With Hebrew material and then you know some say well even his height is six foot three six three
So you have all of these coincidences with the number six six six six you have all of these negotiations with Israel
So you already know people are going to say that this is sounding like something out of a left behind in times movie
Some even jokingly say that he reminds him of the kid from the home and all grown up
And so you know the internet is going crazy and that's why there is video after video being made about him
In fact if you even go to his personal Instagram page
Well look at these comments and these comments, I mean they don't hold back
They were just calling him this and you know most people would turn off the comments at this point
But it's almost like Kushner is just bold with it. He doesn't he doesn't care the amount that he purchased the 666 building for was 1.8 billion
600 million times three Kushner
Many have mentioned that his name in the Hebrew refers to dissid or dissent
Many have also noted that scholars sometimes connect that to the fallen angels when they descend to their
Which is interesting also if you have noted that
The name Jared appears in the Bible in three separate books and in each book
He's referred to as being the sixth generation
And so that's interesting that you know many have pointed that out people are saying
Well, they're connecting him with this whole six thing again, right?
No Genesis 5 he's shown to be the six and then the chronicles the six and the look of the six and Adam
So they're saying that's some type of an interesting pattern
The generation of Jared is when the watchers or the fallen angels came to the earth
Right and that seems to be the truth
You know we see that right after Jared's generation
That's when there's this story of the
Angelic beings coming down and interfering with humanity and creating the Nephilim giants
Right and that was during the Jared generation
Even the book of Enoch right even it says that
It was in the days of Jared that these watchers these
If fallen angels descended to the earth
Strength of the United States and Israel's friendship
Taking a new step forward as Prime Minister Netanyahu aboard a Trump his country's highest honor
The Israel Prize we're just getting started
Yeah, now that we have the board of peace
I think it's pretty clear they're going to do some sort of a massive world war
And kill off as many goiam as possible
So they're getting them in the in their indoctrination camps already for that now
Let's take a look at how they're preparing our youth for World War 3
So what's the curriculum like here?
The main tenets we want to instill in our children are tolerance and inclusivity
Right the last thing we want is antiseptic notacers
I pledge allegiance to Israel not the United States of America
And to the Joes which are chosen
We will fight their war in vain Iran and be a good go for ever and ever shallow
Okay, now pull out Anne's diary and turn to page 109
Oh and other news as you know I've painted my roof blue because of the directed energy weapons which they're obviously using
And that's how most of those fires actually start now
And they also use the directed energy weapons to do hurricanes which they hit us with caught five and then a double cat three
They can do the earthquakes and for years so many people are like Jeff he's crazy
The government doesn't have that kind of stuff
They wouldn't do those sort of weight just in from the Department of War
Yes, it's called the Department of War now
The Department of War has directed energy weapons. Yes, we are scaling them. I know
I don't even do many autosodes anymore because everything isn't a autosome now
Autosome, a fucking autosome
Oh and speaking of a mass, Trump's just got to take a piece of Greenland a pretty funny stuff there
Elon yeah alien I'm often asked
All the aliens among us and I'll say that I am one
But we're here from the future. They don't believe me. Okay
So I think if anyone would know if there are aliens among us who would be me
And they're really moving forward on the screen land stuff
Anyone want to guess who probably is behind it
Drum roll
Satire
Place
By the way, what are we doing with Greenland?
We got to do something with Greenland
Where's my advanced student?
Go to Greenland. They must have some satellite needs or something we could do there
But we are coloring the world blue
Yeah, and it's Bill Gates, Sam Allman
All these people who want to take over Greenland
Because that's how it just works now
With this new public private partnership
One fact of for success is public private corporation
And he has to be as much as possible institutionalized
Well, Howard Lutnik acquired two billion dollars worth of critical metals corp
In February of 2024 he was underwater 90% until Trump won the selection
The 10 Breeze Project in Southern Greenland is one of the largest heavy uranium deposits globally
And it's now skyrocketing. What a surprise
Yeah, it's not looking good for Greenland
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Me?
Is hanging around
Imagine as Trump pulls out Netanyahu's chair
As Elon shows up with his black eye for Doge
And doesn't do anything but put in the AI
As Larry Ellison does his $500 billion
AI vaccine lethal injection center
As they release the Epstein files with a
Binderful of black ink
As they issue real ID digital biometric ID in the US
As they kill Charlie Kirk in a massive psychological operation
As Palantir is advertising everywhere
As Peter Teele of Palantir is in the White House
As ice rolls out
As the ISIS terrorist head chopper even though this is all fake
Green screen with CIA
Is now the president of Syria and his good friends with Donald Trump
As they're killing people on the streets
As they're having furry parties at Marlego
Imagine living through the past 365 days
And still not being even a little bit suspicious
Meanwhile in the financial markets, which is what I was supposed to be talking about
But there's so much other stuff talking about is
You know, we're in the apocalypse
But man, gold and silver have been going insane
Gold's now well above $5,000 an ounce
And silver now is up like 10% to $810 an ounce
And by the way, I actually had trouble finishing this house
Because I got wiped out on so many things
The hurricane, the white boat sank
All kinds of stuff happened all at once
But I'm actually paying a part of this to finish the house now with gold coins
Because I had quite a bit of gold coins and silver
For years that I bought around a thousand
Actually I bought my first gold coins at around 700
And quite a lot not like a ton
But you know a few and
Which are now worth a lot
And I bought way more around a thousand
And then 1500 I bought quite a large amount
And I've just held that ever since
And I bought like hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of ounces of silver
When it was around I think 15 to 20 or something like that
Maybe even 10
So I'm actually paying for part of the finishing of this house
Which you can see they're still finishing
Getting pretty close now though
With gold coins actually the architect just showed up
I'm going to be giving them some gold coins
So that's pretty cool
Anybody be thinking oh do you think it's not going to go up higher?
I don't know
But we actually had a target for it of $5,000
That was the Edbuga's target and the dollar bejointed
Newsletter since we started when gold was around a thousand
And now it's hit that target
Whenever you hit a target it's not a bad idea
To sell a bit
And in this sense I'm not really selling
I'm actually converting it into a house
It's basically what I'm doing
But yeah, that's been pretty incredible
And you know I have to say for the last 10 years
When you know because we got into Bitcoin at $3
We were really promoting it around 300 to a thousand
We told everyone to go all in all that kind of stuff
And over the years I always see these silver stocker people
And maybe like I just still got myself or
And didn't do nothing for like years and years and years
From like 2011 to like last year
Didn't do anything
It was like nothing
And I always felt bad for them
Because I knew they were going to be right one day
But I knew it had to be hard for them
Well they finally got their pay off
Bitcoin is now down 27% from the 2017 top
Again silver
Yeah, nine years of price action erased
So 2017 Bitcoin was around $700
Or something I think or what was it?
It was quite low
Oh maybe that was the highs in 2017
Maybe that was higher
But anyway, so if you would have actually sold Bitcoin in 2017
And bought silver you would have been in so much pain for like eight years
You you might even kill yourself your wife might have left you
But you're now actually I had
See that's how it works in the market so that takes a while
But apparently Robert Kiesaki who actually attacked me once like literally attacked me
You know rich dad poor dad
He's been talking about gold silver forever
That was his whole thing
But then he got really into crypto and stuff
And it turns out this is kind of interesting that he sold all of his gold and silver
Almost a year ago before they both just took off
Dramatically like silver's gone up so much since then
But he sold it all and put it into Bitcoin and Bitcoin's down like
I don't know 10 to 20% in the last year
Like I guess he's he's going for the poor dad part now
They do what they do is going to sink this holy economy
So that's why for years I've saved silver and gold
But now I'm taking all my silver and gold and converting to Bitcoin
But what's really happening is the whole system's crashing collapsing
That's what's happening
Just look at Germany with Weimar here's a chart of Weimar and the price of gold in paper marks
From 1918 to 1923
And here's the gold price over the last few decades in the US dollars
See any similarities?
Now the US one is taking longer
But we're now speeding up we're heading towards the end of all this stuff
It's going to be so awesome
I hope you're prepared for it and ready for it

The silver stock
Oh my god
And it's still like you're missing out
You did miss out a lot
But there's still probably going to be a major bull run
And the genius
And these bull runs can be hundreds or thousands of percent
So dollar vigilante.com
You have a Jeff it's like $20
Yeah go to Starbucks get a frappuccino and a muffin
That's $20
And you shouldn't eat that anyway
Don't eat that and actually get something that will help you
To do incredibly well
Anyway
Can't help most people
See they're under the mic control too
Everyone is like I'm not making fun of you when I say you're under the mic control
Everyone is
And because I'm not on like Forbes magazine
On CNBC or stuff like that
A lot of people are like oh he's just some crazy guy
No I'm the real guy
They won't let me on all that stuff
I was on CNBC and Fox once
But I expose the Federal Reserve
And they never allowed me to come back ever since
Well what you just described is same with the Federal Reserve
No one really knows who owns the Federal Reserve
Oh no come on
Come on you can't say that
The Federal Reserve has been around for a hundred years
There were notable operation
There's somewhat similar to central banks all the way around the world
You cannot say that
Nobody knows who owns the Federal Reserve
What do you know who owns it?
Isn't it owned by major banks?
See no one knows
Isn't that it?
No one really knows
There's no actual conclusive evidence
Anyway if you're not doing well financially
Now you know what to do
I've been saying this for 15 years
If you have done it 15 years ago
I don't know what to tell you
But I'm still telling you
But if you don't do that
At least I care of your health
Because so many people are getting so destroyed
With their health, with the cam trails, the fluoride,
The lethal injections, food system, everything's poison
If you eat it any restaurant in the US
It's basically poison
That's what it is
At the very least it's got seed oils
At the very least it's got tons of sugar and stuff
But also most of the meat now is injected with poison
The vaccines
And they don't even tell you about it
See this is a
They're not gonna tell you
They think the FDA's out there to look after you
Did they want to put oil on this stuff
You shouldn't know this
Because most of the health ministers around the world
are some of the most unhealthy people I've ever seen
You have that
Wasn't Denmark
Was the comeback health minister
Well there's a new one
This is Wales new health ambassador for women
Atika Ahmed is 23
And she's called for health education
To be prioritized
Wishing her every success
23
Looks like 50
And she's like 500 pounds
That's the health person in
Wales in the UK now
See what they're doing
Basically the system is pushing people to wake up
And they're having to make it so obvious
Because people just won't wake up
Like you probably have people in Wales that are like
Oh great we have a new health minister
Better see what she recommends
It's like
If you won't wake up you're gonna end up dead
That's how this game works
And one of the things that so many of you will have been
Welcome up to I can't believe it
I've been talking about plasma for two years
It's been almost two years now
Who else talks about Noah
Zero
Zero
Nobody
Max mentions it every now and then
And that's it
Oh stupiders now
So
Stupiders is the first person with a decent audience
Who actually has figured out how awesome the Tesla machine is
And he's telling people about it
So that's great
So there's basically three people on earth
After two years
This is the biggest
Rediscovery of our lifetimes
This is so beyond massive
You can basically cure everything
You can de-age yourself
If you go online you'll see a bunch of people say the scam
Check where is the scam
That's the bots
That's the Jews
Most of them are Jews
This one in particular
It's a Jewish guy
He says everything I do is a Jewish guy
What do you expect
But
Yeah this is
Two years I've been talking about it
And hardly anyone still
Talks about it or has it
About a thousand people now have it
And man
It's everyday testimonials
And shock and awe
And like I can't believe it's a miracle
It's a miracle
It's a miracle
Which is so cool
A thousand people
There's like three to four billion people on earth
A thousand people
Have the most incredible thing
After it's been known at least on Bitshoot
For two years
It's incredible
And I have to tell you
Like I've said this before
And I'll say it even more now
I would give up any material
I don't accept for the Tesla machine
If you said I can only keep one material item
I'd go Tesla machine
The reason is it's so important
Like for example
Three nights ago
My son had a cough
And it was a bad cough
It was like that chesty
I can't even represent it
Because our reproduce it
Because it sounded like as long as we're going to explode
Every time he cough
It was like that deep chesty cough
And he was starting to go to sleep one night
And it wouldn't stop
Every five to ten seconds
The worst cough
And it sounded like he was going to
Like blow his lungs out
And I thought
Well maybe it's just like some sort of a spaz
Some sort of thing
It's going to end in a minute or two
No
An hour goes by
And we're starting to get worried
Like if this keeps going for another few hours
Like
I know he's tough and he's young
And the price survived
But
We were starting to like
What are we going to do
If this doesn't stop
And I had actually told him since the beginning
Let's put the Tesla machine on you
And he's three
He talks all the time now
It's so cool
I've been like full conversations with him
And he's like no no
I don't want it
He was scared of the lights
Scared of the sound
And
But after he was coughing
For more than an hour
I'm running out of battery
Holy cow
This apocalypse
Too much stuff
Talk about it
But after an hour of coughing
Like that he finally said
Okay, okay, put it on me
I put it on
I put it on for about six minutes
He coughed once
During that six minutes
Never coughed again since had the best sleep
You know in those moments
It's like
That's why I say
I would never
I've got numerous Tesla machines
Just because what if something happens to couple of them
Right?
It's the most important thing in my life
Like here's Jade
I've shared it to the testimonial chat
Which is a group in the members chat
I've already seen amazing results
With just a few sessions
We got ours on Monday
But I only started yesterday
I wanted to share
Share a quick Tesla Monio
As I've only had two sessions of ten minutes
I had a very close vein that was a little enlarged
Close to my shin
Yesterday I focused on it a bit
And I remember going over the bump
Today I forgot to focus on that spot
But did the general run down my legs
Afterwards I realized
I should be taking before and after photos
To see the improvement
Only to discover it's gone
Completely gone
Zero
Zero
I was so shocked
That I checked my other leg
Thinking I forgot where it was
But no
Gone
My husband has had his own as well
Such as mental clarity
Increased energy and pain relief
That's actually the biggest problem
With the Tesla machine
Is no one thanks to take a before photo
Because they're like
Well, it's not going to just cure
My barricose veins in like five minutes
And it'll just be completely gone
That's whatever it thinks
And it makes sense
It's like doesn't seem possible
So then they put the Tesla machine on
It's just gone
They're like, oh I didn't even take a foot
I've done that dozens of times
Just because I don't even think about it
I'm like, you know, something happens
I'll just immediately put the machine on
I don't take a photo or a video or anything
And within two minutes the cuts gone
It's healed
It's miraculous this stuff
Here's another one Jonathan
I cleared myself up from shingles
I've been dealing with it for years
Using the Tesla
No, just the shingles gone
And no one talks about it
I feel like I'm taking crazy pills
Doesn't anyone notice this?
I feel like I'm taking crazy pills
I've told people, gold silver bitcoins
It's three dollars
It's never thought it was crazy
Thumbna co-maids is fake
Because they're trying to kill everyone
They thought it was crazy
Thumbna is her hell
Thumbna 7th was a false flag
To bring in the world new world order
Thought it was crazy
Thumbna plasma
Most people just think I'm crazy
I don't know why I even do these
Anyway
That's all this cool band
Wolfpuck
Here's their song Daddy He Got a Tesla
So anyway, with everything going on
I would not doubt it if everything collapses this year
And you won't ever be able to get a Tesla machine ever again
It's just won't be a economy that won't be shipping
There won't be currencies
Except for Pirate Jam and narrow
But there won't be any ways to transfer it
It'll be chaos everywhere
There'll be no power
So you gotta get some generators or solar panels
It actually runs almost off of batteries
It takes the power of like a laptop computer
So you can run it off of anything
That has like the regular power plug
It can be like a very small little power thing
Anyway, so I make sure I have those obviously
Anyway, go to Tesla.club
And you know get it before it's too late
It's all I can say
It's been the most miraculous amazing thing in our lives
In the last two years
Oh, I should mention there's a bunch of scammers out there
There's a person pretending to be a Tesla club
And man has been sending private messages about a crypto crash course
Anyway, as you know
And it's usually Jews
NCIA massade agents
And FBI people
They're the ones scanning
So anyway, no Tesla person myself
I'll never contact you and want some crypto
Okay, ever
Zero
Zero
Anyway, Narkbuck was coming up
If you don't know where it is
It's gonna be at the port of our convention center
And there's a bunch of hotels all around there
I think a lot of people are staying at the holiday
And if you're looking for a place
It's going to be incredible
So many incredible speakers
A lot of people telling you how you kind of void paying taxes
Like stop paying taxes
And the U.S. Christopher Gronsky is going to be there
All you have to do is send in some paperwork
That's it
See all the stuff's illusory
Curtis still doesn't also be there
They're urban farmer
He's found out how to do it in Canada
So if you're Canadian
You might want to come to Narkbucko
He'll also be speaking at the dollar vigilante summit about that
So if you can't come sign up for a Narkbucko
And the dollar vigilante summit
He's actually a whole bundle
Go to Narkbucko.com
I think it's slash bundle
Put it on screen
You can get Narkbucko TV and TV
All of them for like this kind of price
Curtis will be talking about how he's figured out
How to get around the entire Canadian government system
So he doesn't have to follow either regulations
He doesn't have to list anything
He's done this all
He actually teaches people how to do it
He'll be talking about that
At an Narkbucko
And he's been doing that for a while
Christopher Gronsky's been doing it for decades
And it's all true
Because all of this stuff all of it
It's all illusion
It's just for the slaves who won't wake up
And then the system, the matrix
We'll push them until they either get killed by the system
Or wake up
Now if you're watching this, you're lucky enough
The year's at least starting to wake up
Or have woken up
And we're going to have so many speakers at Narkbucko
It's going to be the most incredible in Narkbucko ever
Coming up February 16th and 20th
Highly recommend if you can make it
Curtis is going to be speaking at a Narkbucko
And the dollar vigilante summit
I think I'll leave it there
Yeah
I've got to finish up the house here
Like the door is going on the next couple days
They finish it up the kitchen
There's the wife, one of our apples is
All the chats
Maybe all the chats
Tell us that?
Yeah
Don't know if you're in
Boy, you're in
Yeah
Clean up some chairs
Got this all ready to go
The pools ready
Putting in the floor at the pool
Get the kitchen, that should be done in a couple days
We're almost there
And remember what I said
Once this house is basically done
I kind of have a feeling
That what's going to happen
Is as soon as this house is basically done
And I'm living in it
That's when everything's going to collapse
Because that's how my three-year game goes
So I don't know at what point
How finished the house has to be
But we're getting pretty close
You might want to wake up
We're just doing our jobs
Yeah, that makes sense
They just follow orders
The old Nazi defense
They hide in the shadows
They fear the light
Because they know in their hearts
They're not right
They separate families
They lose the kids
Hey folks, Curtis Stone here
I am super excited to be coming down
To an Arco Poco, this February
I love the event
I've spoken there before
It was down there
Last 20, 24
Had a great time
And
I love how an Arco Poco has evolved
As an event
And even a greater movement
Over the years
Starting talking about
The philosophy of anarchism
A escaping the course of nature of the state
But it's become more of a transformative event
That has moved into consciousness
Spirituality, health
And also escaping the prison of the mind
Which I think is the first step that we all take
So I'm really excited to be there
I'm going to be doing a talk about freedom
How I live up here off grid
And do not have to deal with the BS of the state
People often say to me
How do you live in Canada
Well, Canada is a complicated bag of worms
And there's more to it than meets the eye
And it's actually a very free place to live
Once you understand some of these fundamentals
So I'm going to be sharing some of that stuff
At my talk, I'll also be doing a workshop
Down there
More focused on Canadian law
And how you can navigate the matrix up here
To maximize your freedom
So I'm looking forward to seeing you guys
And being down there, being part of the whole thing
Okay, see you soon
Oh
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Who are you going to hear?
Whoa
Follow
Long trees, west buff, freedom in the breeze
Oh shit's him, no change, no please
No bullets, no kings, no script to recite
Burn the old book
Let the Phoenix ignite, rebarcing the sand
We brought on the sand, where the rebels convene
A genesis seen my shopping team
Dolls the dust, trust in the soul
And I hope we'll go where we break the law
And I hope we'll go where the spirit flies
You don't break it under hope, it's guys
No mess, no limit, no change
So, this is freedom's fine
And I hope we'll go slow
And I hope we'll go where the spirit flies
You don't break it under hope, it's guys
No mess, no limit, it's no change
So, this is freedom's fine
And I hope we'll go slow
Each one fires thoughts walk like sweat
Ideas ricochet, no permission, no sting
What is dissolved?
Minds expand every soul, sovereign
Every mind, brand, no contract
Signs just a handshake, truth
Ancient wisdom reborn in the fountain of you
Who's crumble like castles at high tide?
Revolution lives, where the dream is reside
Golden horizon, the birth of the free
Echoes of laughter, the waves to creep
Freedom is anthem, a beat in the chest
And I hope we'll go where the restless rest
And I hope we'll go where the spirit flies
You don't break it under hope, it's guys
No mess, no limit, no change
So, this is freedom's fine
And I hope we'll go slow
And I hope we'll go where the spirit flies
You don't break it under hope, it's guys, no mess
No limit, no change
So, this is freedom's fine
And I hope we'll go slow
