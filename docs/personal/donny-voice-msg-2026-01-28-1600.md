## Raw Transcript

Andrew Lou, Stan, I wanted to follow up with you. It's a kind of conveying where I'm coming from. And hopefully we can get somewhere, I don't know. But I hope you know that I've had your back for a long time that I really do have your best interest at heart, that I really do care about you. And that I understand for the most part a lot of what you're going through. I myself have been diagnosed bipolar. I think it's hereditary in our family. I think a lot more people in our family than they would like to care to admit have some type of bipolar. And yeah, you know that I'm not somebody who just, you know, is a sheep or something. So I really do hope that you still value my opinion. And that you know that I'm coming from a place of actual love for you and not a place of -- I don't know whatever you'd want to call it -- of being a normie or just trying to be a dick or whatever.

Andrew, I am -- it really pains me to talk to you because of how much you have changed. I've always loved you. I always thought you were my favorite uncle. I always got along with you. I always remember that. And in my teens, especially when you moved back to grandpa's, you know, you've always been rough around the edges. A little crass, a little offensive at times, but I think that was part of your charm. And I think that angel is still in there. And I think you're a lovely person. But I think you have to be honest to self that I think the darkness, the bad side has been winning. There's a lot more anger than happiness and sadness and darkness than the light that I knew of my angel, my favorite uncle. I think that's my love, very much, and I pray for, very much.

But I don't know if you understand it, but bipolar illness and mental illness, it gets worse, man. Every time you have an episode, it gets easier to have the next one. For me, I had to quit marijuana entirely because it sent me into mania. Well, I -- you know, I don't know where you're currently at. Look, marijuana will send -- if you're bipolar, it is not good for you, but you might think it calms you down, but you know, it can be doing a lot of permanent damage.

And we're trying to say, man, it's getting really hard to talk to you. And it's not -- like, it's because I love you, and I remember the angel uncle that I had, and it's less and less the angel uncle that I know now. And I don't know what to do. Like, you have to understand, I'm having a lower and lower tolerance for mental illness. I just can't really handle it anymore, and that's a me thing.

But like, look, man, I don't know exactly what you're doing. You know, like, you can do whatever you want, okay? I'm not going to judge you on that. But what you have to do is like, you got to make sure you're going to be okay for the future. So if you're not working, I hope you do have savings. You know, I don't know what you're doing, you know? Like, all we see is that you're quitting your job, and you're getting into mental wards, and then you're trying to buy massive properties in a bipolar state. And man, like, if you don't understand -- I've lived with bipolar my whole life and my mom, okay? But bipolars who've ruined their entire lives if they don't get their shit in check. They will go bankrupt, they'll spend all their money, they'll lose all of their friends, everything too.

And that's why, like, I'm just begging you to -- like, I don't know what it is, okay? I'm not saying that the current hospital system is good, I know how bad it is too. But if you can't get this shit under control, dude, it's going to ruin your whole fucking life, right?

And I know you don't like Al anymore and Joe and all these people. Yeah, I get they're normies, okay? But dude, they still love you. And they fucking cried to me, okay? Because they care about you. And you might not feel that, dude. And I get why you're bitter -- like, COVID, dude, I get it. Like, I'm right there with you, I'm right there with you. But these are also people who, like, they don't know -- like, forgive them Lord for they know not what they do, man. Like, these people are your friends and your family who love you and you're isolating from everybody.

And if you want to do that, you can, man, but I'm just asking that like, you try to see where I'm coming from. Like, the damage in your wake -- like, no matter what your choices are, I'm going to argue that you should judge them based off their merits. Like, is your life getting better? Like, are you getting healthier? Are you getting happier? Are you growing in your friendships? Are you getting new friendships? You know, in your marriage? Like, is it getting better or worse? All of these things, right? These are the metrics of success. Okay? Your finances, too -- are you doing better? Are you doing worse? You know, these are all the different metrics of success that you want to be looking at. It doesn't matter about things of the world. And you don't need to be rich or anything either. But my point is, man, if you're honest with yourself, all of this shit is getting way worse in your life.

Like, Sylvie is struggling, man. And I don't pretend to understand your guys' dynamics, okay? All I know is that she's your wife and she's had your back more than any woman I've ever seen have any other person's back. So, you got to choose, dude. You either got to choose to be there for her and you got to heal your shit and you got to work it out, or you got to leave her. Like, you know, her stress and everything is like, you know, it's no good, dude. It's no good.

In your friendships -- like, Al and Joe, they still love you, man. Like, if you could just like, just talk to them without any conspiracies. Because they don't like that. You know, people don't like talking about things they don't like talking about. You know, if you could just like tell them you love them and try to ask about them and like, these things would change, dude. Not everybody is against you and like hates you. We love you, but we're just -- dude. Like, I'm seeing it, man. Like, every time it's harder to talk to you and dude, it breaks my heart and you probably don't care. And you probably don't care.

And you want to know something -- the most annoying thing about you is your fucking stubbornness, dude. Like, there's all -- just total honesty, okay? That first time when you had a mental breakdown, right? And you were naked in the streets -- that's rock bottom for most people. Most people realize at that point, man, I've hit rock bottom. I need to get my fucking shit together. And this is not okay. I can never have this happen again. That is rock bottom for most people. But because of your stubbornness and your pride, you don't see it that way. As soon as you get better, you pretend like it never fucking happened, man. Well, it happened.

And every time that you have one of these episodes -- like, do you know that I know how nasty you were about Joe, okay? Do you know that he fucking broke down in tears? He was sick and ill. Do you know how much that moved him, dude? Like, I've never seen Joe as fucked up as he was that day he was at your house. And I know you just see him as a total asshole. But dude, he was doing the best that he knew. Maybe it wasn't the best he could have done. But I don't think you understand how hard it is for people to see you in these states.

And dude, each time it's going to get worse and worse and worse, man. Like, I don't know what your path is. I'm not here to tell you, like, who you should be and what you should do with your life. That is up for you, man. But what I'm telling you is that you are going down a bad path. And I don't think you can see it. And until you fully acknowledge -- I've hit rock bottom. I need help. I can't do this alone -- it's going to keep getting worse. And that's why I can't really handle talking to you, man. Because it's that attitude. There's no humility. There's no sense of accepting -- I'm in a pretty bad place here. And I need some help. I don't know what to do. It's -- you know, every -- you know best, everybody else is an asshole. Everybody else is an idiot. You know, am I an idiot too? Am I just one other of the idiots? Or maybe I'm somebody who loves you. Maybe I'm one of many people who fucking love you.

You know, maybe I just know a bit more about the world. And I know a bit more about you. And I'm a bit less of an asshole than others, maybe. But... I just... I really, man. Like... Things are going to get worse, right? And you've got to have your wits about you.

And... Again, I don't know what it looks like. But I know what it doesn't look like. And what it doesn't look like is the path you've been on for years. Like these... Going down these endless rabbit holes... Like... They don't bring any relief, man. They don't bring any joy. They don't bring even understanding or remedy or... You know... Like... I don't know. I think, you know, in your own heart, you've got to figure out... Like really what you want. Because I know the lovely... Charming... Funny... Ange is in there, dude. But I gotta tell you... It's appearing less and less and less. And... And it's really, really sad, man. And that's why... It's just hard to even talk to anymore, man.

And I don't know how we get that back. Like... I'm on a -- see, I can't support mental illness anymore. I can't take it, dude. I'm just... I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done.

But... Yeah. I mean... I just want you to know that... Like people actually do love you. Even if they don't have the capacity to like... Love you and care for you and talk to you in the way that you need. Because you are more complex and... You know... But everybody does love you in their own way. And... And I get being resentful about all these people. You know? But we got to forgive, you know? And... We got to move on.

And... You know... I don't know... You know... If this message will help or anything. But I just want to take some time out of my day... To message you... To tell you that... You know... I... I love you, man. And I really wish... for my old uncle back. And I know he's in there.

And... But I think for you to move forward, man. You got to -- you got to admit that your fucking life is going about the -- okay? It's not going well. But it can be. Everything isn't total shit. Everything isn't total garbage. There's a lot of beauty in the world, you know?

But you got to get well, dude. Like... You know... I don't know what that is, you know? For me, when I started getting it, I got off all the weed and all of that very early. And I have to sleep early and I can't drink and I can't do other things. And I got to go easy on stuff and I can't overdo it. And that for me was enough to keep the shit at bay. But I don't know if that is for you, man. I think you've gone beyond. And so, you know, if you're not going to accept that truth, then it's going to keep getting worse. And that's your call, you know?

But yeah, I don't know what it is. I don't know if it's therapy, but I know you need to -- it's never going to change if you don't first accept that something is wrong and that you need help.

And so... Yeah, man, I don't know where you're at. Maybe you think I'm total crazy. You're going to come back, hating me, you know, whatever. And I also really don't appreciate you calling me, leaving me messages and all of this shit. So, I'm hoping we can keep the lines of communication open. And no more of that bullshit will happen again. But yeah, I'm putting a hard boundary. I cannot handle aggression, you know, crazy bipolar spiraling. I don't like the AI shit constantly being posted and pasted. Just fucking talk to me, dude. Just fucking talk to me, like a real person. And I don't give a shit about all of the corruption in the world. Like, there's nothing new there, you know?

If you really want to talk, if you really want to have good conversations, like let's talk about actual solutions and shit we can do. To better ourselves, our relationships, our friendships, our communities -- that sort of interests me. You know? And that's honestly the only path forward that I found, man. None of this shit -- like there's no... It's bullshit, all it's all bullshit, you know?

And so anyways, like... If we can talk in that -- if we can get back to a place where we were -- like I'm all about it. But I don't know what's happening to you, man. I'm going to pray for you.

I do know, like... Everybody knows, man. Like you were a total fucking legend. Hope you know that. You inspired Joe to be successful. You helped Joe be the man he is today. You helped Al be the man he is today. Lord knows where you even learned all the shit that you taught them. But you're a fucking legend, dude. And you can get it back. You know? I really hope so. It's... you know?

Yeah, man. So, I do love you. And I want to be here for you. I do have strict boundaries. I cannot handle any of the... The aggressive phone calls or weird AI or weird conspiracies or all of this shit. I don't want that. But I... I do care about you.

All right, buddy. Cool.
