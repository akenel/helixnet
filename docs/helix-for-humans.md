# Helix for Humans

## What If We Just... Built It?

Everyone talks about "building parallel systems."
Everyone says "we need alternatives."
Everyone waits for someone else to do it.

**We stopped waiting.**

## The Problem (You Already Know This)

- Swiss farmers killing themselves — can't compete with corporate food
- Workers eating gas station garbage — 7 CHF for zero nutrition
- Small businesses crushed by SAP/Oracle consulting fees
- Food supply controlled by 4 corporations
- Your data sold, your choices tracked, your freedom rented

---

## The Solution (We Actually Built This)

**HelixNet** — Open source software for real communities.

### What It Does:

| System | What It Replaces | Status |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| **Farm-to-Locker** | Corporate food chain | Built |
| **Salad Bar Network** | Fast food garbage | Built |
| **Worker Lunch Box** | Gas station robbery | Built |
| **Badge System** | Big Tech login | Built |
| **POS System** | Expensive retail software | Built |
| **Job Board** | LinkedIn surveillance | Built |

### The Chain:

```
MOLLY'S FARM → FELIX'S LAB → DROP LOCKER → YOUR LUNCH
   (grow)        (test)        (pickup)      (eat)
```

No middlemen. No corporate cut. No plastic. No waste.

## Who's Behind This?

Real people. Small network. Swiss-based.

- **SAL** — The connector, lost soul department
- **FELIX** — The lab, quality control
- **MOLLY** — The farm, the kitchen
- **BORRIS** — The builder, custom equipment
- **MARCO** — The machines
- **TIGER** — The code

No investors. No board. No exit strategy.
Just people tired of waiting.

## What We Need

Not money. Not investors.

- **Farmers** who want direct customers
- **Workers** who want real food
- **Builders** who want to contribute code
- **Communities** ready to pilot

---

## The Vision

A network of local food hubs.
Worker-owned. Community-trusted.
Software that serves people, not corporations.

**5 CHF lunch. Real food. No surveillance.**

---

## First Step

Look at the code. Ask questions.
Find one thing you could use.
Tell one person who might care.

That's it. That's how it spreads.
