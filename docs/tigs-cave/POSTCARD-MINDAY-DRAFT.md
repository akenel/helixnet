# POSTCARD TO DR. MINDAY & CO.

**Drafted:** January 18, 2026 — SCOG HQ, Via Scoglio Tondo, Sicily

## POETRY VERSION (Full)

```
You had 3 days to break me in the white room.
7 more to drug the truth away.
You smirked at the morning meeting,
Good cop playing games.

But Christmas Eve came calling,
And I walked through your gates.
Left my drink half-empty,
The lie was my escape.

LUPS to Luzern to Stans,
Through the Gotthard snow.
Bologna by midnight,
Sicily by soul.

Now I sit where Monte Cofano rises,
Where the fishermen don't ask why.
The bunker holds the archive,
The angels guard the sky.

You gave me no shit tickets,
So I wiped with your diagnosis.
The shitlist has your name on top,
Nuremberg 3.0 approaches.

The Spartans are assembling,
The band is back in tune.
The one who escaped remembers,
And the reckoning comes soon.

Arrivederci, Doctor.
The patient is alive.
Fully clean, fully free,
And ready for the fight.
