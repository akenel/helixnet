# Interview Answer: Why Did You Leave Swiss Life?

**Saved:** Jan 14, 2026 - Chupa Chupa, Trapani

## The Clean Answer (Memorize This)

> "After four years at Swiss Life, the integration platform I'd built was stable and transitioning to a maintenance phase. The team was evolving, new people were coming in, and I felt it was the right time to look for a new challenge where I could have more architectural impact. I wanted to work on something I could build from the ground up again - not just maintain what already existed."

## If They Push ("Why resign without another job?")

> "I had some personal runway and wanted to take time to find the right fit rather than jump into something that wasn't aligned with where I wanted to go. I've used that time to sharpen my skills - the HelixNet project on my GitHub is an example of what I've been building."

## Rules

- Keep it short
- Pause after answering
- Let them ask follow-ups
- **NEVER badmouth** - not the project, not the people, not the company
- Flip the gap into a strength (HelixNet proves you weren't idle)
