Third time at Marghe and it keeps getting better. The food is genuinely artisan -- the focaccia and antipasti are on another level, beautifully plated, real ingredients, nothing mass-produced. But what really sets this place apart is the people. The service is personal, warm, and genuinely helpful -- they remember you, they care about what you're eating, they take pride in every plate that leaves the kitchen. The stone interior with the arches gives it a character you don't find in modern places. Great cocktail selection too. Via Garibaldi 52 -- easy to walk past, impossible to forget once you've been inside. One of Trapani's best.
