# SOP: Review First, Card on Pickup

**The Foo Fighter Sales Process**

*"The postcard is the handshake. The coffee is the close."*

---

## Purpose

Turn every service experience into a business relationship. You walk in as a customer, walk out as a partner. The review comes first because you GIVE before you ASK. That's the difference between a salesman and a Foo Fighter.

## The Process

### STEP 1: USE THE SERVICE

- Go in as a regular customer
- Pay full price, no deals, no angles
- Experience the service with your eyes and ears OPEN
- Note what they do well (this becomes your review)
- Note what's missing (no business cards, no online presence, no postcards)

### STEP 2: WRITE THE GOOGLE REVIEW

**Before you leave or same day.** Not tomorrow. NOW.

- Open Google Maps on your phone
- Find the business
- Write a genuine 5-star review (if earned)
- Mention specifics: names, service quality, what impressed you
- Post it publicly

**Why first?** Because when you come back with the card, you've already GIVEN them something valuable. You're not selling -- you're building.

### STEP 3: COLLECT BUSINESS DETAILS

While there or from the review/Maps listing:

- Full business name
- Address (street, postal code, city)
- Phone number(s)
- Email / website / social media
- Services offered
- Hours of operation
- Owner/manager name (if you caught it)
- Google Maps link (for QR code)

### STEP 4: BUILD THE POSTCARD

**Same day. Execute, don't note.**

1. Copy the tent card template: `postcard-camperandtour-TENT-FINAL.html`
2. Pick a theme word (bilingual Italian/English):
   - Camper shop = "Liberta." / "Freedom."
   - Laundry = "Freschezza." / "Freshness."
   - Bar/cafe = "Spirito." / "Spirit."
   - Hotel = "Dualism." (or fit the vibe)
3. Pick a brand color (replaces the red #C41E3A):
   - Blue (#2980B9) for clean/water/fresh
   - Red (#C41E3A) for passion/food/Italian
   - Green (#009246) for nature/organic
4. Update all business details on back panel
5. Write a quote that fits (bilingual)
6. Generate QR code for their Google Maps link
7. Generate PDF: `node scripts/postcard-to-pdf.js input.html output.pdf`
8. **VERIFY THE PDF** -- open it, check 1 page, check layout
9. Copy to `UFA_r2p/` when verified

### STEP 5: PICK UP + DELIVER

When you return to pick up your laundry / collect your order / whatever:

1. They see you, they remember you (you're a customer)
2. They may mention the review -- "Grazie for the review!"
3. **NOW** you pull out the postcard
4. Say: *"I noticed you don't have business cards. I made you something."*
5. Hand it over. Let them look at it.
6. The card speaks for itself -- their name, their address, their QR code, professional design
7. If they love it: *"I can print a stack for you. What do you think?"*

### STEP 6: CLOSE

- If YES: Get quantity, discuss price, schedule delivery
- If MAYBE: Leave the sample, give your number, follow up in 2 days
- If NO: Shake hands, say grazie, move on. Not every fish bites.

**Either way, you've already won:**
- You got great service
- You wrote a genuine review (good karma)
- You practiced the craft
- You have a portfolio piece

## The Math

| Item | Cost | Time |
|------|------|------|
| Service used | Variable (you needed it anyway) | - |
| Google review | Free | 3 minutes |
| Postcard design | Free (template + Tig) | 30 minutes |
| Print at ISOTTO | ~€0.50/card | Next day |
| **Total investment** | **Cost of service + €0.50** | **33 minutes** |

**Return:** A warm lead who already likes you, trusts you, and holds your work in their hand.

## Rules

1. **NEVER pitch before the review is posted** -- give first, ask second
2. **NEVER trash their current setup** -- "I noticed you don't have cards" not "Your marketing sucks"
3. **ALWAYS use the service genuinely** -- you're a customer first, vendor second
4. **ALWAYS bilingual** -- Italian + English, this is Sicily with tourists
5. **ALWAYS same day** -- build the card the day you use the service. Momentum dies overnight.
6. **ALWAYS verify the PDF** -- never hand someone a broken card
