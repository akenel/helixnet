If you're anywhere near Bonagia and you love real pizza, stop everything and go to Pizza Planet.

I walked in on a Sunday night and the energy hit me before the smell did -- five guys in white working around a blazing wood-fired oven like a pit crew. No shortcuts. No frozen dough. Just flour, fire, and two decades of muscle memory.

Ciccio took the time from the fire, introduced himself, shook my hand, and handed me a panino he'd just made -- on the house. That tells you everything about this place. The food is serious but the people are even warmer.

The menu is massive. Classic Margherita, seafood pizzas, calzones, gluten-free and lactose-free options -- they cover every base. Prices are honest: most pizzas between 5 and 9 euros. The wood-fired oven runs all night, and you can watch your pizza go in and come out.

They deliver all across Trapani, which is a game-changer if you're staying at a hotel. One phone call or a WhatsApp message and you've got the best takeaway pizza in Bonagia, Sicily at your door.

Pizza Planet has been here since 2000, feeding the locals who keep coming back -- and the tourists who keep finding it.

Five men. One oven. One mission. Go hungry.
