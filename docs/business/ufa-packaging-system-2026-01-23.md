## Bauhaus Clean. Banksy Beat. Cheap as Dirt.

## THE CONCEPT

Take the photo front pic and the postcard info flip side. Use a paper band with edge cut to seal and frame the two together. Can be separated later if you cut the seal. Print an A4 paper with discreet edge-marked fold points to make an envelope.

**Standard Operating Procedure to close up the message and make it easy and packaged - Bauhaus style with the Banksy beat.**

## THE RITUAL

1. Recipient gets envelope
2. Opens envelope, slides out banded postcards
3. Sees the UFA band seal - "TEAR TO OPEN →"
4. Tears the band (satisfying rip)
5. Two cards separate - front photo, back message
6. Reads the truth bomb
7. Scans the QR code
8. Keeps both cards + maybe the band too

**Every step = engagement**

## WHY THIS WORKS

### BAUHAUS
- Form follows function
- Clean lines
- No waste
- Everything has purpose

### BANKSY
- Street art energy
- Subversive messaging
- DIY aesthetic
- Anti-corporate packaging

### UFA
- Cheap but premium feel
- Replicable by anyone
- Freaks out friends
- Unfuckable

---

## THE PSYCHOLOGY

Fancy packaging = expected, forgettable
DIY packaging = unexpected, memorable

When something LOOKS like it cost nothing but FEELS like it cost everything... that's the magic.

**"It freaks out my friends."** - Exactly.

## HIPPIE SUNSHINE

*"My friends are freaking me out"* - Kasabian

But you ain't lonely anymore. The tribe showed up. Carmello's out there with his cups. The DJ's spinning till 2am. The packaging system costs €3.15 and looks like art.

**That's the beat.**
