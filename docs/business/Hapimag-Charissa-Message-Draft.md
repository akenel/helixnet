# Message Draft for Charissa Rajaram
## Hapimag Integration / Software Architect Application

### LinkedIn Message (for Monday)

Hi Charissa,

Quick follow-up with something concrete rather than another document.

Tonight I built the attached from a camper van in Sicily — a print-ready postcard collection using AI-human collaboration. The workflow: voice notes → AI transcription → design iteration → print-ready PDF. All in one evening session.

**Attachments:**
1. `BBB-postcard-2up-landscape-MAX.pdf` — The output (print-ready postcards)
2. `HelixNet-OneSheet-PinballWizard.pdf` — How it works (1-page technical overview)

For a vacation sharing community, I thought demonstrating remote work creating vacation content was more relevant than architecture diagrams.

This is what modern integration architecture looks like in practice — systems that enable rapid iteration from anywhere.

Happy to walk through the technical stack or discuss how this approach applies to Hapimag's digital transformation goals.

Best regards,
Angelo Kenel

### Why This Works

1. **Shows, doesn't tell** — Actual deliverable vs. claims
2. **Relevant context** — Vacation content for vacation company
3. **Demonstrates the role** — Integration architecture in action
4. **Memorable** — Nobody else is sending postcards from Sicily
5. **Technical depth available** — One-pager backs up the "how"
