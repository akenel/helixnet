Hey Kevin! Thanks for the birthday wishes!

Speaking of new chapters - I've been building something that might interest you from a Bos&Co perspective.

Remember when you guys went with SAP B1? I've been working on an AI-powered integration layer called HelixNet that sits on top of existing systems and handles the data transformation/traceability stuff that SAP charges a fortune for.

Basically: supply chain visibility without the SAP upgrade tax.

Still on for spring? You mentioned camper convoy - perfect timing. I can demo the whole thing live from the road. This is literally how I work now.

Attached is something I built tonight from the camper deck in Sicily. Voice notes in, print-ready postcards out. Same pipeline works for purchase orders, inventory, shipping docs - anything.

Give Kathy a hug. Looking forward to spring!

### Why Kevin is Perfect

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Existing relationship | 20+ years, trust built |
| SAP B1 customer | Knows the pain, bought through Angelo |
| Supply chain business | Footwear = materials → factory → warehouse → retail |
| Spring visit planned | Live demo opportunity, camper convoy |
| Decision maker | Owner, can say yes |
| Honest feedback | Friend will tell you if it's garbage |

### The Bos&Co Use Case

**Current State (SAP B1):**
- Basic inventory management
- Manual data entry between systems
- Limited visibility across supply chain
- Expensive to customize

**HelixNet Upgrade:**
- AI-driven data transformation
- Connect existing systems without migration
- Full traceability: leather source → factory → container → warehouse → store
- Voice-to-document workflows for field ops
- Fraction of SAP consulting costs

---

### Spring Convoy Demo Plan

1. **Camper setup** - Two vans, mobile office
2. **Live workflow** - Kevin watches the pipeline in action
3. **Real data test** - Feed actual Bos&Co files through HelixNet
4. **Feedback session** - What works, what's missing
5. **Decision point** - POC engagement or just friends camping

---

### The Play

- Charissa (Hapimag) = Job application
- Kevin (Bos&Co) = POC customer + honest feedback

If Kevin sees value → real customer story for other pitches
If Kevin doesn't → honest feedback from a friend, no harm done
