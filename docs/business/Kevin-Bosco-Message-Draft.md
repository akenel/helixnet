Hey Kevin! Thanks for the birthday wishes!

Speaking of new chapters - I've been building something that might interest you from a Bos&Co perspective.

Remember SAP B1? I've been working on an AI-powered layer called HelixNet that sits on top of existing systems - handles transformation, traceability, the stuff SAP charges a fortune for. Your escape hatch from the tariff tracking, bean counter bullshit, CRM user fees - all of it.

But here's the idea that'll really cook your noodle:

**Custom AI shoes.** Customer draws a design. AI processes it. Portugal factory whips them up ISO. Train the boys, ship it out. Bos&Co signature line - one of one. You'd eat that up.

Still on for spring? I've got the big Pilot rig rented - we do the convoy like the old days. You and Kathy take my NB, I'll run behind with the monster. Maybe hit Spain (Candidate trade in May), then Portugal - your turf. Demo HelixNet live from the road.

Oh - and I made these tonight from the camper deck in Sicily. Pick the one you want, send me your address (don't forget the postal code), and I'll mail you a signed collector edition. Museum quality. First one's free for old Weber Street roommates I kicked out.

Give Kathy a hug. Looking forward to spring!

### Why Kevin is Perfect

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Existing relationship | 20+ years, trust built |
| SAP B1 customer | Knows the pain, bought through Angelo |
| Supply chain business | Footwear = materials → factory → warehouse → retail |
| Spring visit planned | Live demo opportunity, camper convoy |
| Decision maker | Owner, can say yes |
| Honest feedback | Friend will tell you if it's garbage |

### The Bos&Co Use Case

**Current State (SAP B1):**
- Basic inventory management
- Manual data entry between systems
- Limited visibility across supply chain
- Expensive to customize

**HelixNet Upgrade:**
- AI-driven data transformation
- Connect existing systems without migration
- Full traceability: leather source → factory → container → warehouse → store
- Voice-to-document workflows for field ops
- Fraction of SAP consulting costs

### Spring Convoy Demo Plan

**THE CONVOY:**
```
VAN 1 (NB - Angelo's camper)     VAN 2 (Big Pilot - rented)
├── Kevin driving                 ├── Angelo driving
├── Kathy shotgun                 ├── Sylvie floats between
└── Blocking in front             ├── Andre "StrayDog" - wheelchair bed
                                  └── Walkie talkie link
```

**ROUTE:**
1. Spain - Candidate Trade (May, 3 days)
2. Portugal - Kevin's turf, speaks Portuguese
3. Maybe Venice remake (documented in repo)

**LIVE DEMO:**
- Kevin watches the pipeline in action
- Feed actual Bos&Co files through HelixNet
- Custom AI shoes proof of concept
- Feedback session - what works, what's missing

---

### The StrayDog Factor

**Andre Stray** - strayandre@hotmail.com (since 2005)
- Wheelchair-enabled, in pain
- Terminal case - needs to get out
- Invite him to the convoy: "Bosco's booked. Get out of there. 10-day vacation."
- He gets his own bed in the big Pilot rig

---

### The Custom AI Shoes Pitch

This is THE ticket for Bos&Co:

1. **Customer draws design** - sketch, photo, whatever
2. **AI processes it** - HelixNet transforms to production spec
3. **Portugal factory whips them up ISO** - Kevin's boys know the drill
4. **Bos&Co signature line** - one of one, museum quality
5. **Train the boys** - not that hard, Kevin would eat this up

---

### The Play

- ~~Charissa (Hapimag)~~ = Finished, maybe they call
- **Kevin (Bos&Co)** = THE ONE REAL CUSTOMER
- Andre (StrayDog) = Bring him back to life

If Kevin sees value → real customer story, custom shoes line
If Kevin doesn't → honest feedback from a friend, convoy anyway
