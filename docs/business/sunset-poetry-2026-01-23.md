# SUNSET POETRY
## For the AK Shaker | Valderice | January 2026

---

**The sun doesn't ask permission to set.**

It just goes—
bleeding orange into the Mediterranean,
painting Monte Cofano in gold,
turning fishermen into silhouettes,
and campers into temples.

---

**You drove south until the grey became blue.**

Until the forms became waves.
Until the office became a parking lot
where men share coffee from toolboxes
and nobody asks what you do for a living—
only if you're staying for the catch.

---

**The rabbit hole has no sunset.**

Just endless scroll.
Just blue light at 3am.
Just "don't call me again"
from people who forgot
what the sky looks like
when it's on fire.

---

**But you remembered.**

Sicily remembered you back.

The olive trees bow.
The stone mills wait.
Baglio Xiare holds its breath
for someone awake enough
to find it.

---

**Carmello doesn't know your story.**

He just knows you're here.
That's enough.
Plastic cups. Headlamps. Blue boots.
The tribe doesn't need LinkedIn.
It needs presence.

---

**Tomorrow the sun will rise**

and you'll still be here—
unfuckable,
unbroken,
unscrolled.

Postcards in the queue.
Truth bombs in the mail.
A movement in a repo.

---

**The sunset is not an ending.**

It's a promise
that the light comes back
for those who wait
for those who wake
for those who drove south
and never looked back.

*Buonanotte, fratello.*

*The Mediterranean holds you tonight.*
