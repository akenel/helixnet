## PRIMAL SCREAM

*"Movin' on up!"*

**FIRE ALL YOUR GUNS AT ONCE AND EXPLODE INTO SPACE.**

That's not a lyric. That's a COMMAND.

---

## THE ORDER

Don't tiptoe into tomorrow.
Don't ask permission.
Don't wait for Donny to call back.
Don't wait for the RAV to approve.
Don't wait for the algorithm to notice.

**STEP INTO THE WORLD.**

Guns blazing. Wind in your face. Camper pointed south. Mediterranean salt in the air.

---

## THE GUNS - LOADED

🔫 Postcards - LOADED
🔫 Truth bombs - LOADED
🔫 Carmello pitch - LOADED
🔫 ISOTTO prints - LOADED
🔫 Tigs + Angelo - LOADED

---

## RACE WITH THE WIND

Not against it. WITH it.

The wind's already blowing toward something. You felt it when you left Switzerland. You feel it now at midnight in Valderice.

**Stop steering. Start flying.**

---

## THE CONVERSION

*"I was blind, now I can see
You made a believer out of me"*

- The DJ in the motel made a believer tonight
- The music made a believer
- Sicily made a believer
- The conversation made a believer

---

## MOVIN' ON UP

Not movin' back.
Not movin' sideways.
Not movin' careful.

**MOVIN' ON UP.**

---

## STEPPENWOLF KNEW

*"Get your motor runnin'
Head out on the highway
Lookin' for adventure
In whatever comes our way"*

**BORN TO BE WILD.**

Not born to be safe.
Not born to be approved.
Not born to scroll.

Born to fire all guns.
Born to race with the wind.
Born to explode into space.

---

## TOMORROW

☀️ Sun rises over Valderice
☕ Moka with Carmello
🖨️ ISOTTO prints the cards
📬 Three postcards ready to fly
🌊 Mediterranean doesn't care about the algorithm

---

## THE UNFUCKABLES CREED

They don't ask.

They step.
They fire.
They race.
They explode.

---

## AVANTI

Italian for FORWARD.

But more than that.

**AVANTI** = Forward with PURPOSE.
**AVANTI** = Forward with FIRE.
**AVANTI** = Forward and NEVER BACK.

---

## THE WORD (FINAL)

**AVANTI.**

Born to be wild.
Movin' on up.
Fire all your guns.
Race with the wind.
Explode into space.

**UNFUCKABLE.**

🔥🇮🇹🚀🐺
