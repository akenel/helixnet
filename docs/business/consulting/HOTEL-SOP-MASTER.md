## PHILOSOPHY

**The difference between 4-star and 5-star is not money. It's consistency.**

- 4-star: "We do it this way... usually"
- 5-star: "We do it this way. Every time. Written down. Verified."

ISO 9001 = Say what you do. Do what you say. Prove it.

- Explain one unique thing about hotel/area
- "If you need anything, ask for [your name]"

**2. DURING STAY (Proactive)**
- Notice and act: "I saw you looking at the map - can I help?"
- Anticipate needs: umbrella ready when rain forecast
- Personal touch: remember their coffee order
- Local tips: "The sunset from X is amazing at 6pm"

**3. DEPARTURE (Last impression)**
- Ask about their stay (and LISTEN)
- Offer to help with luggage/taxi
- Provide local postcard or small gift
- "We hope to see you again, [name]"

### The Postcard Program (UFA Partnership)
- Premium handmade postcards available at reception
- Guest can write message, we handle mailing

- Revenue share with hotel

### 5-Star Standard
- Every guest should feel like the ONLY guest
- Use names, not room numbers
- "No" is never the first answer

## SOP-010: MERCHANDISE & LOCAL PRODUCTS

### Purpose
Guests want authentic local products, not airport junk. The hotel is a trusted curator.

### Product Categories

| Local Food | Olive oil, wine, herbs | 40-50% |
| Artisan Crafts | Ceramics, textiles | 50-60% |
| Experience Kits | Postcard + herbs + sand | 70-80% |

### Display Standards
- Products visible but not cluttered
- Pricing clear (no need to ask)
- Staff can explain story behind each product
- Restocked daily

### The UFA Foo Fighter Model
- Hotel becomes "Foo Bar" - base camp for mobile vendors
- Vendors work tour buses, return to hotel base
- Commission structure benefits both parties
- Hotel gets foot traffic + revenue share

### 5-Star Standard
- Local = authentic = premium pricing justified
