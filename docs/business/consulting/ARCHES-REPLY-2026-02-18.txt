Dear Jane,

Thank you for reaching out. The topic is directly in my area of expertise and I would be happy to participate.

I am currently leading the architecture and development of an enterprise microservice platform (FastAPI, Keycloak OIDC, Docker) positioned as an SAP alternative for European SMEs. I work extensively with AI-assisted development workflows and have first-hand experience with the challenges and success factors of AI transformation at the organizational level.

I am available for a 1-hour consultation call. Please send the discussion guide at your convenience and let me know the preferred scheduling options.

Best regards,

Albert-Daniel Kenel
Architect / Development Lead
