ARCHES PRE-INTERVIEW SURVEY -- DRAFT ANSWERS
==============================================
Use these as reference. Put in your own words on the form.
Keep answers short -- this is a vetting step, not the interview.
Save the good stuff for the paid call.


Q1: Full overview of company-wide AI project, challenges, countermeasures
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am currently architecting an enterprise microservice platform (HelixNet)
that integrates AI-assisted development directly into the engineering workflow.
The platform targets European SMEs as an alternative to SAP, built on FastAPI,
Keycloak OIDC, and Docker orchestration.

AI is embedded at two levels:
1. Development process: AI pair programming for code generation, testing,
   debugging, and deployment automation. This reduced a typical 8-16 week
   UAT environment setup to a single afternoon.
2. Platform features: AI-assisted data processing and workflow automation
   for end users.

Key challenges:
- Legacy mindset: enterprise clients expect 6-month implementation cycles
  and resist the speed that AI-assisted workflows enable
- Skill gap: traditional IT teams lack experience integrating AI tools
  into existing development pipelines
- Trust and verification: AI-generated code requires rigorous QA processes
  to maintain production-grade quality
- Data governance: ensuring AI tools do not leak sensitive enterprise data

Countermeasures:
- Lean team structure with direct decision authority (no review boards)
- Systematic verification workflows: every AI output is tested before deployment
- Open source stack to avoid vendor lock-in and maintain full control
- Incremental adoption: AI augments existing workflows rather than replacing them


Q2: Current status and factors behind outcome
----------------------------------------------

The project is in active UAT with external testers accessing the platform
on dedicated cloud infrastructure. The core system is operational:
identity management, role-based access control (5 roles), service management
modules, and a POS system are all functional in production-grade configuration.

Factors behind the positive outcome:
- Decision speed: architectural decisions are made and executed in hours,
  not weeks. No committee approvals required.
- AI-augmented velocity: tasks that traditionally require a team of 4-6
  developers are handled by 1 developer with AI assistance, at higher speed
  and comparable quality.
- Cost efficiency: total infrastructure cost is under EUR 10/month for a
  full enterprise stack that would cost EUR 50,000-200,000 in a corporate setting.
- Direct ownership: the person making decisions is the person writing the code.
  No handoffs, no lost context, no telephone game.


Q3: Key Success Factors for AI implementation
----------------------------------------------

1. Leadership with technical depth. AI transformation fails when decision
   makers do not understand the technology. The people approving AI strategy
   must be the people using AI tools.

2. Start with real problems. Successful AI implementation solves an existing
   pain point on day one. Failed implementations start with "we should use AI"
   and then look for a problem.

3. Reduce decision latency. The single biggest factor in AI project success
   is how fast the organization can move from idea to deployment. AI generates
   output in seconds. If the organization takes weeks to approve that output,
   the AI advantage is wasted.

4. Verification over trust. Never deploy AI output without systematic testing.
   The speed gain from AI is lost if you ship bugs. Build verification into
   every step.

5. Small teams over large committees. AI multiplies individual capability.
   A team of 2 with AI outperforms a team of 12 without it. Reorganize
   around capability, not headcount.


AVAILABILITY (next week)
------------------------
Angel is in Sicily, CET (UTC+1). Japan is JST (UTC+9). That is +8 hours.

Slot 1: Monday Feb 23, 17:00 CET / 01:00 JST (Tue Feb 24)
Slot 2: Tuesday Feb 24, 10:00 CET / 18:00 JST
Slot 3: Wednesday Feb 25, 10:00 CET / 18:00 JST

(The 10:00 CET slots map to 18:00 JST which is reasonable for Japan side.)
