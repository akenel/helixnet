Hi Jane,

Thank you for the quick follow-up. I want to be transparent so we set the right expectations.

My tenure at Nestle predates the current AI wave. At that time, AI transformation was not yet on the enterprise agenda. From what I know through former colleagues, they are still running SAP PI/PO for integration with no active migration to BTP, and Kubernetes adoption has not started. That is fairly typical for large FMCG enterprises -- the legacy stack is deeply embedded and change is slow.

My direct hands-on experience with AI transformation comes from my current work: architecting and building an enterprise platform (HelixNet) that integrates AI-assisted development into the full engineering lifecycle. This is not theoretical -- I deployed a production UAT environment this week in one afternoon that would take a corporate team 8-16 weeks. I can speak in depth about:

- AI-assisted development at enterprise scale (code generation, testing, deployment)
- Why legacy enterprises struggle to adopt AI (decision latency, permission structures, skill gaps)
- Practical success factors based on real implementation, not slide decks
- The gap between where companies like Nestle are today and where the technology already is

If the client values first-hand practitioner experience over a Nestle-specific case study, I am confident the call will be highly valuable. I will leave that to your judgement.

For scheduling, mornings CET work better:
