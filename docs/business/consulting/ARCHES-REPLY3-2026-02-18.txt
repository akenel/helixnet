Hi Jane,

Great to hear the client wants to proceed.

Before the call, they may find this useful -- a short video (4 minutes) where I walk through exactly what I described: the production deployment we did in one afternoon versus what it takes in a corporate environment.

It covers the tech stack, a live demo of the running system, and the comparison with enterprise timelines and costs. Should give them a concrete sense of my approach before we speak.

Looking forward to confirming a time slot.

Best regards,
Angelo
