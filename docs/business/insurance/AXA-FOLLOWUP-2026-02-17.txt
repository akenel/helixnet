Subject: Schadennummer 22831735/0001 -- No Response Since Feb 11 -- Urgent Follow-Up

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear AXA Claims Team,

I am writing regarding claim number 22.831.735/0001 (vehicle fire and water damage, Fiat Ducato camper van).

It has now been six days since my last communication with your vehicle expert, Mr. Ivan Zgraggen, and eight days since he informed me the case was being transferred to an English-speaking colleague. To date, no one from AXA has contacted me.


TIMELINE OF NON-RESPONSE

  Jan 26:  Mr. Zgraggen took over as vehicle expert, requested photos
  Jan 26:  I provided all requested photos, damage description, and repair location
  Feb 9:   Mr. Zgraggen informed me he cannot communicate in English
           and forwarded the case to an English-speaking colleague
  Feb 9:   I asked for the name and contact details of the new handler -- no answer
  Feb 11:  I followed up again with two paid invoices ready to submit --
           Mr. Zgraggen replied that he had forwarded all emails and
           directed me to send documents to schaden@axa.ch
  Feb 11 to today:  Complete silence. No handler assigned. No acknowledgment.
                    No next steps communicated.


I want to be clear about two points:


1. ENGLISH SERVICE IS CONTRACTUAL

I specifically selected and pay for AXA coverage that includes English-language service. "I don't speak English" is not an acceptable reason to leave a claim unattended for weeks. I expect a qualified, English-speaking claims handler to be assigned and to contact me within 48 hours.


2. TWO SEPARATE DAMAGE CLAIMS REQUIRE ACTION


A) Fire Damage (Electrical Short -- Stove Installation)

Invoices paid and ready to submit:

  Camper & Tour sas
  Sebastiano Cassisa, Via F. Culcasi 4, 91100 Trapani
  EUR 1,010.00 -- Electrical repair, wiring replacement, stove installation

  PuntaTipa Hotel
  91010 San Vito Lo Capo (TP)
  EUR 1,395.50 -- Emergency accommodation during repair (no deductible per policy)

  TOTAL: EUR 2,405.50

These invoices have been paid out of pocket. I am requesting reimbursement as confirmed by the original claims handler.


B) Water Damage (Roof Seal Failure)

Discovered February 6, 2026 during repair at Camper & Tour, Trapani. Multiple roof seals failed, causing water infiltration behind ceiling panels. Structural damage to roof. Detailed estimate is being prepared by the repair shop. This is a separate claim that has not yet been initiated because no handler is available to process it.


WHAT I NEED FROM AXA IMMEDIATELY

  1. Confirmation that claim 22.831.735/0001 is active and assigned
  2. Name and direct contact of my English-speaking claims handler
  3. Instructions for submitting the two fire damage invoices (EUR 2,405.50)
  4. Initiation of the water damage claim (separate incident, same vehicle)

I am currently located in Trapani, Sicily. I can be reached by email or on my Swiss mobile number on file.

I trust AXA will resolve this promptly. If I do not receive a response within 48 hours, I will escalate through the AXA ombudsman and, if necessary, through the Swiss Insurance Ombudsman (Ombudsman der Privatversicherung).

Kind regards,
