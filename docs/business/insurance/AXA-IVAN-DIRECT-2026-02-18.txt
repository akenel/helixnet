Subject: Schadennummer 22.831.735/0001 -- LETZTE MAHNUNG / FINAL NOTICE -- Response Required by Friday Feb 21

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mr. Zgraggen,

This is my fourth attempt to get a response from you or anyone at AXA regarding claim 22.831.735/0001. I am writing to you directly because the general claims inbox produces nothing.

I will keep this simple.


MY OBLIGATIONS TO AXA: FULFILLED

This morning I paid AXA CHF 1,231.45 for my 2026 premium (UBS execution date 19.02.2026, reference 228317351100015750387083723). Payment confirmation is attached.

I have never missed a payment. I have never been late. I have fulfilled every obligation under this contract.


AXA'S OBLIGATIONS TO ME: UNFULFILLED

Since January 26, I have provided every document, every photograph, and every invoice you requested. In return, I have received exactly one week of communication followed by complete silence since February 11.

No handler assigned. No reimbursement processed. No status updates. Nothing.


CLAIM 1: FIRE DAMAGE -- EUR 2,405.50

I checked the AXA claims portal today. I can see EUR 1,010 acknowledged for the fire repair (Camper & Tour). However, the emergency hotel accommodation of EUR 1,395.50 (PuntaTipa Hotel, San Vito Lo Capo) appears nowhere in the system. Was this claim received? Was it rejected? Was it lost? Nobody has told me.

Both invoices have been paid out of pocket. Both were submitted. I am waiting for full reimbursement of EUR 2,405.50.


CLAIM 2: WATER DAMAGE -- TECHNICAL REPORT ATTACHED

Attached is the official technical report from Camper & Tour S.a.s. (Sebastiano Cassisa, Via F.sco Culcasi 4, 91100 Trapani), dated 18 February 2026. The report will be signed by Simona, the technician who performed the inspection. A formal repair quotation will follow separately.

Key findings from the report:

  - More than HALF the camper ceiling is rotted through, including part of the driver's cab
  - Toxic black mould is present throughout the internal roof structure
  - The damage was HIDDEN -- only visible after removing the skylight for inspection
  - The adhesives (presumably original from manufacturer) had completely crumbled
  - Infiltration from BOTH skylights is presumed to date back a long time

The report concludes with an urgent recommendation. I quote directly:

  "HABITATION IS ADVISED AGAINST until repairs are completed."
  "The owner currently lives in the camper and has no alternative accommodation without the vehicle."

Mr. Zgraggen, I am living in a vehicle that a qualified technician has declared uninhabitable due to toxic mould. I have no alternative housing. I am stranded in Trapani, Sicily, waiting for AXA to process a claim that has been open for nearly a month.


WHAT I NEED FROM YOU BEFORE FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 21

  1. Confirmation that claim 22.831.735/0001 is active
  2. Name, email, and phone number of my assigned English-speaking handler
  3. Status of fire damage reimbursement (EUR 1,010 repair + EUR 1,395.50 hotel)
  4. Acknowledgment that the water damage report has been received
  5. Next steps for the water damage claim, including whether emergency accommodation will be covered while the vehicle is uninhabitable

If the language barrier is the reason for the delay, I will say this plainly: use a translation tool. It is 2026. Language is not an acceptable reason to leave a policyholder stranded for weeks.


FINAL NOTICE

I have been patient and cooperative throughout this process. That patience has a limit.

If I do not receive a substantive response by Friday, February 21, I will file a formal complaint with the Swiss Insurance Ombudsman (Ombudsman der Privatversicherung). I will include the full correspondence history, the technical report, and the payment confirmation showing that I am fulfilling my contractual obligations while AXA is not.

I sincerely hope it does not come to that. But after four weeks of silence, I need you to understand that I have no other option.

I am available by email or on my Swiss mobile number on file. I can be reached at any time.
