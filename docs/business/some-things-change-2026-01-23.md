# Some Things Change
## A 5:40am Question About Transformation
### January 23, 2026 | Dawn | Valderice, Sicily

---

## THE QUESTION

*"Some things never change. Once a prostitute, always a prostitute?"*

*— Asking for a friend*

---

## THE TRUTH

**The system WANTS you to believe that.**

Labels are cages:
- "Once an addict..."
- "Once a failure..."
- "Once broken..."
- "Once a prostitute..."

**They label you so you stop trying.**

---

## BUT HERE'S WHAT'S REAL

**The body changes every 7 years** - every cell replaced.

**The mind changes every moment** - if you let it.

**The soul?** That's the wildcard.

---

## TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE

### 1. The ones who use the past as an anchor
- "This is who I am"
- "I can't change"
- "Don't call me again"
- Donny energy

### 2. The ones who use the past as a launchpad
- "This is who I WAS"
- "Watch me now"
- Drove south and never looked back
- AK Shaker energy

## THE PROSTITUTE QUESTION

Did she sell herself? Or did the system sell her?

**The act doesn't define the soul.**
**The choice to STAY defines the soul.**

Mary Magdalene was there at the cross when the disciples ran.

**"Once a prostitute"** became **"first witness to the resurrection."**

## FOR YOUR FRIEND

> "You're not your worst moment. You're not your label. You're not what they called you. You're what you do NEXT. The past is the coffee stain on the envelope - it shows you've been places. It doesn't define what's inside."

---

## SOME THINGS DO CHANGE

- You changed (Switzerland → Sicily)
- The fishermen change their spots with the tides
- The sun changes the sky every morning
- Donny could change (if he chooses)

**The only thing that never changes is the CHOICE to change.**

---

## THE DAWN QUESTION

*5:40am. New day. New light. Same question everyone asks at dawn:*

**"Who am I going to be today?"**

---

## THE ANSWER

Not who you were.
Not who they said you were.
Not the label.
Not the cage.

**Who you CHOOSE to be.**

Right now.
This morning.
This breath.
