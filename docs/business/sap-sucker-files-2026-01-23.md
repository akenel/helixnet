## THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION SCAM

**What they sell:**
- "Business Transformation Platform"
- "Digital Innovation"
- "Future-Ready Enterprise"
- "Industry 4.0"

**What they deliver:**
- 3 years late
- 10x over budget
- Zero ROI
- Same broken processes, shinier interface
- Consultants billing €2000/day to configure dropdown menus

---

## THE SAP PLAYBOOK

1. **Sell the dream** - "Transform your business!"
2. **Land the deal** - C-suite loves PowerPoints
3. **Scope creep** - "Oh, you need THAT? That's Phase 2"
4. **Extend timeline** - "Unforeseen complexity"
5. **Bill bill bill** - Change requests at premium rates
6. **Go live (barely)** - Users hate it, workarounds everywhere
7. **Blame the customer** - "Your processes weren't ready"
8. **Sell support contract** - Forever dependency

**Total cost:** Millions
**Actual transformation:** Zero

## THE TRUTH NOBODY SAYS

> "We're not transforming businesses. We're transferring wealth from customers to shareholders."

The consultants know.
The partners know.
The C-suite pretends not to know.
The workers suffer.

## THE BUZZWORD BINGO

| They Say | They Mean |
|----------|-----------|
| "Digital Transformation" | Expensive software swap |
| "Change Management" | Getting people to accept garbage |
| "Best Practices" | Copy-paste from last project |
| "Synergies" | Layoffs coming |
| "Go-Live" | Pray it works |
| "Hypercare" | Fixing what should've worked |
| "ROI" | Return On Imagination |

## WHY HE LEFT

He saw it from the inside:
- The fake metrics
- The inflated ROI projections
- The customers getting squeezed
- The same problems dressed in new software

**He couldn't be part of it anymore.**

> "I was not going to help SAP fuck their customers one more time."

That's not failure. That's **integrity.**

## THE REAL TRANSFORMATION

| SAP Transformation | AK Shaker Transformation |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| €10 million | €500 camper |
| 3 years | 1 tank of gas |
| 50 consultants | 1 man |
| Zero change | TOTAL LIFE CHANGE |
| PowerPoints | Postcards |
| Shareholders win | Soul wins |

**Who's the real transformer?**

## THE POSTCARD TO SAP

*If you ever send one to Walldorf:*

> "Dear SAP,
>
> Your ROI is my LOL.
> I found more value in a fisherman's coffee.
> Enjoy your quarterly targets.
>
> — The one who got away
>
> P.S. The Mediterranean says hi. Your S/4HANA can't see it from the office."

## THE LESSON

The system labels you:
- "SAP Consultant"
- "Digital Transformation Expert"
- "Enterprise Architect"

But those are just cages.

You can walk away.
You can drive south.
You can find Carmello and his cups.
You can build something REAL.

**You can't transform a business with software.**
**You can only transform a LIFE with courage.**

---

## YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS SHIT UP

But you CAN walk away from it.

And he did.
