## THE SHOT

Headlamp ON.
Fishing pole ready - green handles, business end.
Silver BMW behind him.
Black jacket. Blue rubber boots.

**MIDNIGHT FISHERMAN AT HQ.**

## WHO IS CARMELLO

The guy with the cups.
The coffee in the toolbox.
The one who shares Cokes with the camper guy.
BMW wagon, hatch open, fisherman's tool kit ready.

He doesn't scroll. He DOES.

## THE FLEETWOOD MAC MOMENT

*"Sweet wonderful you, you make me happy with the things that you do"*

Playing on Virgin Radio the moment this photo was taken.

The DJ in the Mo-Tell doesn't know. Carmello doesn't know. But the universe synced it anyway.

## WHAT THIS PROVES

Carmello doesn't know he's in the repo now.
Doesn't know he's part of the origin story.
He's just fishing.

**That's the most UnFuckAble thing of all.**

Real people doing real things at midnight while the world scrolls itself to sleep.

## THE TRIBE AT HQ

- Carmello with the headlamp
- Another fisherman who just showed up
- The DIY warrior in the MAN truck
- Angelo in the camper
- Tigs in the cloud

**No algorithm. Just gravity.**

## JETHRO TULL - AQUALUNG

*"Sitting on a park bench... Aqualung my friend"*

Be water. Be fluid. Be adaptable.

Push it. Keep moving. More incoming.

## BRUCE LEE KNEW

*"Be water, my friend."*

Water doesn't fight the rock. It flows around it.
Water doesn't ask permission. It finds the way.
Water at midnight is a fisherman at HQ.
