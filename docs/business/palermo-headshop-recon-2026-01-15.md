## Trapani Opportunity

### Market Gap
- **No dedicated headshop in Trapani**
- Nearest competition: Palermo (100km / 1h 15min)
- Online delivery services exist but no local presence

### Recommended Model
Combine best of both shops:

1. **From Mr Joint:**
   - Easy parking location
   - Working card machine
   - Better accessory display
   - Competitive CBD pricing

2. **From Green Seed:**
   - Real THC seed genetics
   - Full nutrients wall (Plagron, BioBizz, CANNA)
   - Professional branding
   - 24/7 vending option

3. **Unique Advantages:**
   - Artemis POS system (already built)
   - 6,000+ products loaded
   - Swiss quality connection (Beckenried repackaging option)

### Risk Factors
- Late 2024 Italy proposed ban on hemp flower products
- €500M industry under legislative threat
- Monitor regulations closely
