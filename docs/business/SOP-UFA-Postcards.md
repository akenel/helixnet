## The Formula

```
DIGITAL CONTACT (comment/call/message)
         ↓
    "Wake up" message planted
         ↓
PHYSICAL FOLLOW-UP (postcard)
         ↓
    Can't be deleted, scrolled, or ignored
         ↓
      UNFUCKABLE
```

## Phase 1: Digital First

1. **Identify target** - Someone you know with a mailing address
2. **Make contact** - Video comment, email, call, message
3. **Plant the seed** - Truth bomb, wake-up call, invitation
4. **Document it** - Screenshot the comment/message for reference

**Examples:**
- Comment on their video (Rumble, YouTube)
- Reply to their social post
- Send a voice message
- Have a phone call

## Phase 3: Local Printing

### The Problem
Local printers are thick. They:
- Can't do duplex on thick paper
- Freak out when you bring your own paper
- Don't understand "flip and print other side"

### The Solution: DIY Assembly

#### Materials Needed
| Item | Purpose | Where to Get |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Thick paper (200-300gsm) | Postcard stock | Your own Epson paper or buy card stock |
| Paper cutter/guillotine | Clean edges | Amazon, office supply |
| Strong glue stick or spray adhesive | Bond front + back | Hardware store |
| Colored electrical tape | Frame/seal edges | Hardware store |
| Bone folder (optional) | Smooth bubbles | Craft store |

#### Print Process
1. Go to local printer (ISOTTO, etc.)
2. Give them `FRONT.pdf` - print on thick paper, COLOR
3. Give them `BACK.pdf` - print on thick paper, B&W or COLOR
4. **Two separate pages** - don't ask for duplex, they'll fuck it up
5. Take prints home

#### Assembly Process
1. **Cut both prints** to exact 6" × 4" size
2. **Align carefully** - edges must match
3. **Apply glue** evenly to back of FRONT print
4. **Press together** - smooth from center outward
5. **Remove bubbles** - use bone folder or credit card
6. **Seal edges** with colored electrical tape (1-2mm border)
   - Black = classic
   - Gold = premium
   - Red = urgent/important
7. **Let dry** under heavy book for 1 hour

## Phase 4: Quality Control

### Checklist Before Mailing
- [ ] Image is crisp, colors correct
- [ ] Text is readable, no smudges
- [ ] Edges are clean and sealed
- [ ] Address is complete and correct
- [ ] Stamp area is clear
- [ ] Overall feels premium, not DIY-janky

### The Test
> *"Would I be proud to receive this?"*

If yes → Mail it
If no → Redo it

## Phase 5: Mail It

### From Italy to International
| Destination | Postage | Delivery |

| Europe | ~€1.25 | 5-7 days |
| USA/Canada | ~€2.20 | 7-14 days |

### Mailing Tips
- Use Italian postmark (that's the point - proof of location)
- Write "POSTCARD" on it if customs might question
- No envelope - postcards mail naked
- Take photo before mailing for records

## Final Notes

**Why postcards?**
- Physical = permanent
- Can't be deleted, shadow-banned, or algorithm-buried
- Sits on desk, fridge, wall
- Personal touch in a digital wasteland
- Collectible if done right

**The goal:**
> Create artifacts that outlive the algorithm.
