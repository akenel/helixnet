# Page 1: Executive Summary

## The Partnership

This proposal formalizes an expansion of our existing partnership into the Italian CBD market, specifically targeting Sicily as a proof-of-concept territory.

**The Team:**

| Partner | Role | Contribution |
|---------|------|--------------|
| Felix (Artemis) | CBD Expert & Production | 25 years Swiss CBD, regulatory knowledge, **vape production (100 units/hour)** |
| Sylvken | Marketing & Packaging | Brand design, packaging, customer experience, existing website |
| Angelo (HelixNet) | Technology & Operations | ISO 9001 compliance platform, VAT tracking, business development |
| Vito (Proposed) | Local Operations Sicily | 20+ years port industry contacts, location negotiations, Italian market knowledge |
| Miki (Romania) | Frontend & UX Support | Web design, user experience, technical support |

**Existing Infrastructure:**
- **Ecolution GmbH** (Swiss company, established 2015) - Already operational, bank accounts, VAT registration
- **Zurich Lab Connection** - Validation and testing via existing account
- **Felix's Production Line** - Vape filling capability proven at scale, ready for CBD production

**Note:** Vito is a potential Sicily operations partner - independent professional with deep relationships across Italian ports. Final partnership terms TBD.

---

## The Opportunity

**Sicily has no dedicated CBD presence in Trapani** - a city of 70,000 with significant port traffic (Egadi Islands ferries) and zero competition.

Field reconnaissance (Palermo, January 2026) confirmed:
- Existing shops are disorganized, cash-heavy, compliance-light
- No vending machine presence for CBD products
- Tourist traffic underserved
- Local market uneducated but receptive

**Mosey's Rule applies:** Any decent vending machine within 100 meters of a train station or ferry terminal is a money maker if managed properly.

---

## The Solution

**Helix CBD Max** is a refrigerated vending operation with a three-tier product strategy:

### Product Tiers (by margin)

| Tier | Products | Role | Margin |
|------|----------|------|--------|
| **1. Foundation** | Cold beer, drinks, snacks | Revenue stability, warm climate demand | Low-Medium |
| **2. Core** | **CBD Vapes** (Felix production) | Primary profit driver, 100 units/hour capacity | **High** |
| **3. Premium** | CBD flower, oils, accessories | Differentiation, repeat customers | Medium-High |

### Infrastructure

1. **Ecolution GmbH** (est. 2015) - Existing Swiss company, no setup required
2. **Harbin vending machines** (Italian-made) - Euro-native, lease model, refrigeration standard
3. **Felix's production line** - Vape filling proven at scale (100/hour)
4. **Zurich lab** - Existing account for validation/testing
5. **HelixNet platform** - ISO 9001 batch tracking, VAT compliance, full traceability
6. **Location partner model** - Local restocking, shared revenue, 3-strike accountability

**The insight:** Beer pays the rent. Vapes pay the profit. Flower builds loyalty. No single point of failure.

---

## The Differentiator

> **VAT compliance is the catch.**

Italian headshops operate in grey zones. When regulators tighten (and they will), compliant operators survive. Non-compliant operators close.

HelixNet provides:
- Batch tracking from clone to customer
- Lab test integration (THC % verified)
- VAT calculation done correctly (after discounts, not before)
- Full audit trail for any inspection

**We don't just sell CBD. We sell CBD that can survive an audit.**

---

## The Ask

We propose a 12-month pilot in Sicily:

| Item | Approach |
|------|----------|
| Company | **Ecolution GmbH** (existing - no setup costs) |
| Supply | Grow Motion AG / Benny clones, 0.5% THC target |
| Vape Production | Felix fills CBD vapes (100/hour capacity) |
| Lab Testing | Zurich lab (existing account) |
| Machines | Marco's Harbin network, lease model, €10-12K |
| First location | Trapani (port area or train station) |
| Investment | **€15-25K total** (reduced - no company formation) |
| Timeline | Machine live by Q2 2026 |

**Felix's role:** Vape production, supply chain, quality assurance, regulatory guidance
**Sylvken's role:** Packaging, branding, customer materials
**Angelo's role:** Technology, operations, location partnerships, Ecolution GmbH administration

---

## Why Now

1. **Angelo is on the ground in Sicily** - Already building relationships (Vito, gym network)
2. **HelixNet is ready** - ISO 9001 framework built, batch tracking operational
3. **Sylvken returns end of January** - Packaging design can begin immediately
4. **No competition in Trapani** - First mover advantage
5. **Felix's Swiss credibility** - Legitimizes the operation from day one

---

## Known Gotchas & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Italian hemp ban passes** | CBD product line illegal | Beer/snacks continue; CBD is bonus not survival |
| **THC lab variance** (0.5% tests as 0.62%) | Product seized, legal costs | Clone consistency, 0.5% target gives buffer under 0.6% limit |
| **Location partner fails** | Empty machine, lost revenue | 3-strike rule, backup locations pre-scouted |
| **DHL shipment lost** | Restocking delayed | Local buffer stock with Vito, multiple shipping options |
| **Cash skimming by partner** | Revenue underreported | Card-preferred machines, regular audits, trust but verify |
| **Vending license delays** | Launch delayed | Start paperwork early, Vito knows local bureaucracy |
| **Competition copies us** | Price war, margin pressure | First mover advantage, compliance moat, relationship network |
| **Single supplier (Grow Motion)** | Supply interruption | Benny maintains mother plants we own; backup supplier relationships |

**Philosophy:** Every gotcha has a mitigation. Beer revenue insulates CBD risk. Compliance outlasts cowboys.

---

## Success Metrics (12 months)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Machines deployed | 2-3 |
| Monthly revenue (total) | €3,000-5,000 |
| Revenue split | ~70% beer/drinks, ~30% CBD |
| Compliance audits passed | 100% |
| Location partners retained | 80%+ |
| Customer complaints | <5 |

---

## Next Steps

1. Felix reviews and provides feedback
2. Sylvken designs initial packaging concepts
3. Angelo scouts and secures first Trapani location
4. Legal: Swiss GmbH paperwork initiated
5. First machine order placed with Marco

# Page 2: Market Analysis

## Field Research: Palermo, Sicily (January 15, 2026)

On-the-ground reconnaissance of Sicily's CBD market. Two top-rated shops visited, purchases made, operations observed.

---

## Shop 1: Mr Joint Italy (Via San Lorenzo 192)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Google Rating | 5.0 stars (33 reviews) |
| Size | Super small |
| Parking | Easy, off beaten path |
| Payment | Card working |
| Vending | Hemp Care 24/7 outside |
| English | Good |

**Product Pricing:**
- Amnesia CBD flower: 38% CBD, 0.3% THC - **€6.67/gram**
- CBD seeds only (no THC genetics)
- Basic grow gear (Plagron, CANNA)
- Better accessory selection

**Key Observation:** Owner nervous about police testing. Higher CBD % = more scrutiny. If police test, owner pays for lab work.

---

## Shop 2: Green Seed Growshop (Via Dante 35)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Google Rating | 5.0 stars (62 reviews) |
| Size | Small but well-stocked |
| Parking | Nightmare - deep city center |
| Payment | **Card machine BROKEN** |
| Vending | 420 machine 24/7 outside |
| English | Weaker |

**Product Pricing:**
- Amnesia CBD flower: 25% CBD, <0.5% THC - **€15/gram**
- Hash: €15/gram
- **Real THC seeds available** (Dutch Passion, Barney's, Sensi, RQS)
- Massive nutrients selection (Plagron, BioBizz, CANNA, BAC, T.A.)

**Key Observation:** Legally safer (branded prepackaged products). More confident operation. Full grow shop, not just CBD.

---

## Price Comparison Matrix

| Product | Mr Joint | Green Seed | Opportunity |
|---------|----------|------------|-------------|
| CBD Flower/gram | €6.67 | €15.00 | Price between = margin |
| CBD % | 38% | 25% | Quality matters |
| THC Seeds | No | Yes | Differentiation |
| Nutrients | Basic | Massive | Stock what sells |
| Card Payment | Yes | Broken | **Basic competence wins** |

---

## The Trapani Gap

### Current State
- **Zero dedicated headshops in Trapani**
- Population: ~70,000
- Nearest competition: Palermo (100km / 1h 15min drive)
- Online delivery exists but no local presence
- No vending machines

### Why This Gap Exists
1. Smaller city = less obvious opportunity
2. Palermo dominates Sicilian commerce
3. No local entrepreneur has moved yet
4. Regulatory uncertainty scares conservative operators

### Why We Fill It
1. Angelo is already there (GYM 4U, Vito, local relationships)
2. Port traffic (Egadi Islands ferries) = tourist customers
3. First mover advantage
4. Vending model = low overhead, 24/7 sales
5. Beer/drinks revenue de-risks CBD uncertainty

---

## Tourist Traffic Potential

### Trapani Port
- Ferry terminal to Egadi Islands (Favignana, Levanzo, Marettimo)
- Peak season: 500+ tourists/day waiting for ferries
- Impulse buy environment
- Cold drinks + CBD = perfect combo

### Train Station
- Trapani Centrale
- Connects to Palermo, Marsala
- Commuter + tourist traffic
- 100m rule applies

---

## Competitive Advantages Over Palermo Shops

| Factor | Palermo Shops | Helix CBD Max |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Location convenience | City center (parking nightmare) | Port/station (easy access) |
| Operating hours | 10-13, 16-19 (siesta gap) | **24/7 vending** |
| Payment | One shop has broken card | Card + cash from day 1 |
| Compliance | Informal, nervous | **ISO 9001 tracked** |
| Beer/drinks | No | **Yes - revenue stability** |
| Audit-ready | No | **Yes - HelixNet** |

---

## Market Size Estimate (Conservative)

### Trapani + Surrounding Area
- Population: ~100,000 (Trapani + Erice + Marsala commute zone)
- Estimated CBD users: 2-5% = 2,000-5,000 people
- Average purchase: €15-20
- Purchase frequency: 2x/month

### Monthly Addressable Market
- Low estimate: 2,000 × €15 × 2 = **€60,000/month**
- High estimate: 5,000 × €20 × 2 = **€200,000/month**

### Realistic Capture (Year 1)
- Target: 2-5% market share
- Monthly revenue: **€1,200 - €10,000**
- Midpoint target: **€3,000-5,000/month** (aligns with success metrics)

**Note:** Beer/drinks revenue adds €1,000-2,000/month baseline regardless of CBD performance.

---

## Key Insight

> Both Palermo shops have 24/7 vending machines outside. **The vending model is already validated in Sicily.** We're not inventing a new concept - we're deploying a proven model to an underserved location with better execution (working card machines, beer, compliance tracking).

---

## The Vape Opportunity

From Mosey's Rule (KB-020): **"VAPES, VAPES, VAPES!"**

Neither Palermo shop emphasizes vape production. They resell. We produce.

| Factor | Palermo Shops | Helix CBD Max |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Vape source | Third-party resale | **Felix production (100/hour)** |
| Quality control | Trust supplier | **In-house, lab verified** |
| Margin | Standard retail | **Production margin** |
| Customization | None | Brand our own |

**Felix's capability:** Proven vape filling at scale. CBD production uses same equipment and process. Lab validation via existing Zurich account.

> "Vapes are what's selling NOW. CBD flower is the niche differentiator." — Mosey's Rule

# Page 3: The 100m Rule & Location Strategy

## Mosey's Rule

> "ANY DECENT VENDING MACHINE WITHIN 100 METERS OF ANY TRAIN STATION ARE MONEY MAKERS IF MANAGED PROPERLY"
> — Mosey, Swiss vending industry veteran

This is not theory. This is field-tested wisdom from operators running profitable machines.

---

## The Formula

```
VENDING SUCCESS = LOCATION + CALIBRATION + BEST SELLERS

1. LOCATION (100m Rule)
   └─ Within 100 meters of train station OR ferry terminal
   └─ High foot traffic
   └─ Commuters/tourists = impulse buyers
   └─ 24/7 potential customers

2. CALIBRATION (Equipment/Site)
   ├─ SAFE:    Secure from vandalism
   ├─ SECURE:  Proper locks, camera coverage
   ├─ POWER:   Reliable electrical connection
   └─ ACCESS:  Easy for restocking

3. BEST SELLERS (Restock Strategy)
   └─ Stock what's HOT today
   └─ Not what was hot last year
   └─ Adapt to market trends (currently: vapes)
```

---

## Trapani Target Locations

### Priority 1: Porto di Trapani (Ferry Terminal)

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Traffic | 500+ tourists/day peak season (Egadi Islands ferries) |
| Dwell time | 30-60 min wait for ferries |
| Demographics | Tourists, day-trippers, families |
| Competition | Zero vending for CBD/vapes |
| Products fit | Cold drinks (waiting in heat), CBD (vacation relaxation), vapes |
| Contact | Vito (port industry connections, 20+ years) |

**Why this works:** Captive audience waiting in heat. Impulse buy environment. No competition.

### Priority 2: Trapani Centrale (Train Station)

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Traffic | Commuters + tourists to/from Palermo, Marsala |
| Dwell time | 10-30 min platform wait |
| Demographics | Mixed local/tourist |
| Competition | Standard snack machines only |
| Products fit | Cold drinks, quick vape purchase, CBD for travel |
| Contact | Municipal permit required |

**Why this works:** Classic 100m rule application. Proven model across Europe.

### Priority 3: Nettuno Area (Waterfront)

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Traffic | Evening passeggiata, nightlife |
| Dwell time | Extended (bars, restaurants nearby) |
| Demographics | Young locals, tourists |
| Competition | Bars sell beer (but close at night) |
| Products fit | Late-night beer, CBD, vapes |
| Contact | Local business relationships (GYM 4U network) |

**Why this works:** 24/7 machine serves after-hours demand when bars close.

---

## Backup Locations (Pre-Scouted)

Critical for 3-strike rule: if primary location partner fails, immediate alternatives ready.

| Backup | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Erice cable car station | Tourist | High season traffic |
| Marsala centro | Expansion | Wine tourism crossover |
| Trapani airport | Long-term | Requires airport authority approval |
| Beach areas (San Vito) | Seasonal | Summer-only consideration |

---

## Location Partner Model

We don't buy real estate. We partner with existing businesses.

### The Deal Structure

```
HELIX CBD MAX          LOCATION PARTNER
─────────────────      ─────────────────
Provides machine       Provides space + power
Supplies inventory     Restocks (DHL delivery)
Handles compliance     Reports issues
Sets prices            Collects revenue share
                       ↓
              REVENUE SPLIT: TBD (typically 70/30 or 80/20)
```

### Partner Accountability

| Strike | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| 1st | Warning + conversation |
| 2nd | Formal notice |
| 3rd | Machine relocated to backup location |

**Philosophy:** Win-win or move on. No drama. Backup already scouted.

---

## Sicily Niche Strategy

We do NOT scale to all of Italy. We niche.

```
YEAR 1: Trapani only (prove the model)
YEAR 2: Palermo expansion (if Trapani profitable)
YEAR 3: Eastern Sicily consideration (Catania, Siracusa)

NEVER: Mainland Italy (different market, different regulations, different mafia)
```

**Why niche?**
- Sicily is an island = natural boundary
- 5 million population = enough market
- Manageable logistics (van can reach any point in 3 hours)
- Build relationships deep, not wide
- Become "the Sicily vending guys"

---

## Key Insight

> The 100m rule is not about the machine. It's about the **humans walking past.**
>
> Ferry terminal: humans waiting, bored, hot, have money, want something NOW.
> Train station: humans in transit, impulse decisions, quick purchases.
> Waterfront: humans relaxing, open to new experiences, evening mindset.
>
> Put the right products where humans are already gathered. That's it.

## The 0.5% THC Strategy

Italian legal limit: **0.6% THC**

Our target: **0.5% THC**

**Why the buffer?**

| Scenario | Our Position |
|----------|--------------|
| Lab tests at 0.5% | ✓ Compliant |
| Natural variance (+0.05%) | ✓ Still compliant at 0.55% |
| Different lab equipment (+0.05%) | ✓ Still compliant at 0.55% |
| Police test with margin of error | ✓ Buffer protects us |

**How we achieve it:**
1. Clone consistency (same genetics every time)
2. Controlled growing conditions (Grow Motion Year 1)
3. Lab testing BEFORE shipment to Italy
4. Reject any batch over 0.55%

## Year 1 vs Year 2+ Model

### Year 1: Swiss Indoor

```
Grow Motion AG → Lab Test → Felix Production → DHL → Sicily

Cost: Higher (indoor Swiss production)
Quality: Guaranteed
Volume: Limited
Risk: Low (proven facility)
```

### Year 2+: Outdoor Farmer Network

```
Benny Clones → Sicilian/Italian Farmers → Lab Test → Packaging → Local Distribution

Cost: Lower (outdoor, local)
Quality: Controlled via clones
Volume: Scalable
Risk: Medium (weather, farmer reliability)
```

**Transition criteria:** Year 1 profitable + reliable farmer partners identified.

## Supply Chain Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Grow Motion can't deliver | No product | Benny maintains backup mothers; alternative Swiss suppliers |
| Batch fails lab test | Delayed shipment | Buffer inventory; reject early, retest |
| DHL loses shipment | Empty machine | Local buffer stock with Vito; insurance |
| Felix unavailable | No vape production | Flower-only sales temporarily; cross-train backup |
| Clone contamination | Genetic drift | Multiple mother plants; regular genetic verification |

## Key Insight

> We own the genetics. We control the quality. We test before we ship.
>
> The supply chain is not "buy from whoever" — it's a controlled pipeline where every step is documented and every batch is traceable.
>
> This is the ISO 9001 difference. This is why we survive audits.
