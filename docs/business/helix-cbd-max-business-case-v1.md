## Business Case v1.0 | January 2026

# Page 1: Executive Summary

## The Partnership

This proposal formalizes an expansion of our existing partnership into the Italian CBD market, specifically targeting Sicily as a proof-of-concept territory.

**The Team:**

| Partner | Role | Contribution |
|---------|------|--------------|
| Felix (Artemis) | CBD Expert | 25 years Swiss CBD industry, regulatory knowledge, supply chain, production capability |
| Sylvken | Marketing & Packaging | Brand design, packaging, customer experience |
| Angelo (HelixNet) | Technology & Operations | ISO 9001 compliance platform, VAT tracking, business development |
| Vito (Proposed) | Local Operations Sicily | 20+ years port industry contacts, location negotiations, Italian market knowledge |

**Note:** Vito is a potential Sicily operations partner - independent professional with deep relationships across Italian ports. Final partnership terms TBD.

---

## The Opportunity

**Sicily has no dedicated CBD presence in Trapani** - a city of 70,000 with significant port traffic (Egadi Islands ferries) and zero competition.

Field reconnaissance (Palermo, January 2026) confirmed:
- Existing shops are disorganized, cash-heavy, compliance-light
- No vending machine presence for CBD products
- Tourist traffic underserved
- Local market uneducated but receptive

**Mosey's Rule applies:** Any decent vending machine within 100 meters of a train station or ferry terminal is a money maker if managed properly.

---

## The Solution

**Helix CBD Max** is a refrigerated vending operation with premium CBD as the high-margin add-on:

1. **Refrigerated machines first** - Cold beer, drinks, snacks = consistent revenue in warm climate
2. **CBD as premium line** - Higher margin, differentiated, but not survival-dependent
3. **Harbin vending machines** (Italian-made) - Euro-native, lease model, refrigeration standard
4. **Swiss GmbH sells CBD into Italy** - Clean legal structure for regulated products
5. **HelixNet platform** - ISO 9001 batch tracking, VAT compliance, full traceability
6. **Location partner model** - Local restocking, shared revenue, 3-strike accountability
7. **Product flexibility** - If CBD regulations tighten, beer keeps the lights on

**The insight:** Beer pays the rent. CBD pays the profit. No single point of failure.

---

## The Differentiator

> **VAT compliance is the catch.**

Italian headshops operate in grey zones. When regulators tighten (and they will), compliant operators survive. Non-compliant operators close.

HelixNet provides:
- Batch tracking from clone to customer
- Lab test integration (THC % verified)
- VAT calculation done correctly (after discounts, not before)
- Full audit trail for any inspection

**We don't just sell CBD. We sell CBD that can survive an audit.**

## The Ask

We propose a 12-month pilot in Sicily:

| Item | Approach |
|------|----------|
| Supply | Grow Motion AG / Benny clones, 0.5% THC target |
| Machines | Marco's Harbin network, lease model, €10-12K |
| First location | Trapani (port area or train station) |
| Investment | €20-30K total (conservative) |
| Timeline | Machine live by Q2 2026 |

**Felix's role:** Supply chain, quality assurance, regulatory guidance
**Sylvken's role:** Packaging, branding, customer materials
**Angelo's role:** Technology, operations, location partnerships

---

## Why Now

1. **Angelo is on the ground in Sicily** - Already building relationships (Vito, gym network)
2. **HelixNet is ready** - ISO 9001 framework built, batch tracking operational
3. **Sylvken returns end of January** - Packaging design can begin immediately
4. **No competition in Trapani** - First mover advantage
5. **Felix's Swiss credibility** - Legitimizes the operation from day one

## Known Gotchas & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Italian hemp ban passes** | CBD product line illegal | Beer/snacks continue; CBD is bonus not survival |
| **THC lab variance** (0.5% tests as 0.62%) | Product seized, legal costs | Clone consistency, 0.5% target gives buffer under 0.6% limit |
| **Location partner fails** | Empty machine, lost revenue | 3-strike rule, backup locations pre-scouted |
| **DHL shipment lost** | Restocking delayed | Local buffer stock with Vito, multiple shipping options |
| **Cash skimming by partner** | Revenue underreported | Card-preferred machines, regular audits, trust but verify |
| **Vending license delays** | Launch delayed | Start paperwork early, Vito knows local bureaucracy |
| **Competition copies us** | Price war, margin pressure | First mover advantage, compliance moat, relationship network |
| **Single supplier (Grow Motion)** | Supply interruption | Benny maintains mother plants we own; backup supplier relationships |

**Philosophy:** Every gotcha has a mitigation. Beer revenue insulates CBD risk. Compliance outlasts cowboys.

## Success Metrics (12 months)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Machines deployed | 2-3 |
| Monthly revenue (total) | €3,000-5,000 |
| Revenue split | ~70% beer/drinks, ~30% CBD |
| Compliance audits passed | 100% |
| Location partners retained | 80%+ |
| Customer complaints | <5 |

## Next Steps

1. Felix reviews and provides feedback
2. Sylvken designs initial packaging concepts
3. Angelo scouts and secures first Trapani location
4. Legal: Swiss GmbH paperwork initiated
5. First machine order placed with Marco
