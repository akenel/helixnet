# THE HELIX COMICS — Concept Document

> "Out of the mouths of babes, the truth will be explained."
> — The Babbling Brook, December 2024

## THE BIG IDEA

**What if a 5-year-old could teach a CTO how to fix a toaster?**

Not metaphorically. Literally.

We create comic strips SO SIMPLE that:
1. Kids understand them
2. Kids can DRAW them (LEGO style)
3. Kids explain them to confused adults
4. Adults finally understand HelixNet
5. CTOs stop burning toast

---

## THE STYLE: LEGO PEOPLE

```
Why LEGO style?

✅ Universal - every kid knows LEGO
✅ Simple shapes - circles, rectangles, done
✅ No artistic skill needed to recreate
✅ Instantly recognizable
✅ Fun to color
✅ Non-threatening (unlike UML diagrams)

    ┌───┐
    │ o │  ← Circle head, dot eyes
    ├───┤
    │   │  ← Rectangle body
    └─┬─┘
     / \   ← Simple legs

That's a LEGO person. A 5-year-old can draw this.
A CTO cannot draw a microservices architecture diagram.
Advantage: LEGO.
```

## THE TRUTH

```
"If you can't explain it to a 5-year-old,
 you don't understand it yourself."
 — Probably Einstein, definitely true

"If a 5-year-old can explain it to a CTO,
 maybe the CTO will finally understand."
 — The Helix Comics, December 2024
```

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. [ ] Create 4-6 pilot comic strips (text first)
2. [ ] Design LEGO character templates
3. [ ] Test on actual kids (do they laugh?)
4. [ ] Test on actual CTOs (do they learn?)
5. [ ] Build into Daily Dashboard (comic of the day)
6. [ ] Coloring book PDF for download
