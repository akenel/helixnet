## THE INVITATION

To Sydney: Will you start the fire?
To Frankfurt: Will you carry it forward?
To Boston: Will you bring it home?

To every village in between: Will you join?

This is not a festival.
This is not a concert.
This is not entertainment.

**This is a demonstration of freedom.**

We stop because we CAN.
We sing because we MUST.
We do it with REAL instruments because we're REAL people.

---

*"It's a long way to the Stop if you want to rock'n roll"*

Yeah it is.

But we've got until April.

**Let's GO.**
