  HUNT → HEART → COMMENT (all in one motion) - no going back. That's the way.

  SOUNDCLOUD TIPS FOR JAPAN

  - Add "full" or "original" if you get remixes: Plastic Love original
  - Japanese titles sometimes work better — but English usually finds it
  - Look for play count — higher = better upload quality
  - Skip "nightcore" or "slowed" versions — you want the real thing
  - Check length — if it's 1:30, it's probably a clip, keep scrolling

  YOUR FLOW

  1. Copy song name from list above
  2. Paste in SoundCloud search
