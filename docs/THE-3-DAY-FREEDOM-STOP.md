Not in chaos. Not in violence. Not in anger.

In MUSIC.

Every town. Every village. Every city. Every street corner.

The stage is set. The prep is done. And on Wednesday, April 1st, 2026...

**We rock this world.**

## THE PHILOSOPHY

> *"I had a dream. I wanted freedom in this world for me."*

This isn't protest. This isn't rebellion.

This is DEMONSTRATION.

Demonstrating that we CAN stop.
That the machine runs because WE run it.
That if we all just... pause... and sing...

**Everything changes.**

Gandhi made salt. We make music.

Same revolution. Different instrument.

## THE VISION

Picture it:

**Sunrise in New Zealand** — First guitars strum
**Rolling through Asia** — Drums join in
**Across Europe** — The villages light up
**Into Africa** — The rhythm deepens
**The Americas wake up** — Full orchestra now
**Back to the Pacific** — The circle completes

24 hours. One unbroken song. Every human who wants to participate, participating.

Not watching on a screen.
BEING THERE.

In their village. In their street. Under their tree.

**Meeting by the big tree. Coming along.**

---

## THE PROMISE

We make no promises we can't keep.

But we promise:

**120%.**

Everything we have. Everything we are.

For 3 days. For freedom. For the dream.
