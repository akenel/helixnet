# CORNELIA'S DREAM

## South Italy, 2011

*"Leo knows my soul."* — Cornelia, December 16, 2025

## THE DREAM

Cornelia dreamed that all the people of the world said:

**"ENOUGH IS FUCKEN ENOUGH."**

- Children are hungry
- People are hungry
- The rich in Switzerland have all expense luxuries
- Musicians sing about the world and give nothing back
- Too much plastic. Too much fake. Barbie world.

## WHAT WE WANT

```
🌱 A piece of land — for growing veggies
🏠 A little house — shelter
🔥 Fire — warmth
⚡ Electricity — light
👥 Gathering — teach everyone to get back to their roots
🌸 Blümle — little flowers, real things
🕊️ Peace
```

**That's not radical. That's what humans had for 10,000 years.**

## THE TRUTH

The songs belong to the PEOPLE. Always did.

Sam Cooke didn't die rich.
Víctor Jara was murdered for his music.
Fela fought the government with every note.

The Sunrise Chain isn't just a playlist.
It's Cornelia's dream with a SOUNDTRACK.

## APRIL 1st, 2026

The world stops working for THEM.
And starts living for US.

One village. One fire. One song.
Real food. Real people. Real peace.

*"A change is gonna come..."*

It already started. In a room in Switzerland.
With Angel and Cornelia and a tiger named Leo.

**Blümle.** 🌸🌱🌊
