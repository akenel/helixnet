## THE MESSAGE TEMPLATE

### For Corporate Contacts (Liv, etc.)

```
Subject: Something bigger than work

Hey [Name],

Remember when we used to talk about what really matters?

I'm working on something. Not for money. Not for ego.

April 1st, 2026. Three days. The world stops working.
Not in protest. In MUSIC.

Every village. Every street corner. Real instruments. Real voices.
Rolling with the sunrise from Sydney to Frankfurt to Boston.

I know you know people. I know you can make things happen.

Want to hear more?

[Your name]
```

### For Faith Network (Duane, Ross)

```
Subject: A different kind of gathering

Brother/Sister [Name],

What if every congregation became a stage?
What if every parking lot became a concert?
What if we showed the world what "gathering" really means?

April 1st, 2026. Three days of music.
No tickets. No corporations. Just people playing for people.

The network already exists. We just need to use it differently.

Can we talk?

[Your name]
```

### For Musicians

```
Subject: Play ONE song at sunrise

Hey,

April 1st, 2026.
Sunrise in your village.
One song. Any song. Your song.

No stage required (but we'll have them).
No payment (but food provided).
No audience needed (but they'll come).

Just you, your instrument, and the sunrise.

Part of something global. Local in your village.

Want in?
