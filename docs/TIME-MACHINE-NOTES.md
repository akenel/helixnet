# TIME MACHINE NOTES
## A Journey Through the Wire — Angel & Tig, December 2025

We traveled light. We saw what we needed. Here's what we brought back.

## THE PRINCIPLES

### From Tesla (Colorado Springs, 1899)
```
1. RESONANCE      — Match the frequency. Energy moves without force.
2. MEDIUM         — It's everywhere. YOU are the wire.
3. STANDING WAVES — Energy ARRIVES. The space between is irrelevant.
4. IMPULSE        — Sharp pulses. Not streams. Nature speaks in bursts.
5. NODE/ANTINODE  — Know when to be still. Know when to PUSH.
```

### From De Forest (New York, 1906)
```
6. AMPLIFICATION  — Small signal controls massive flow.
                    A whisper becomes a roar.
```

### From Bardeen & Brattain (Bell Labs, 1947)
```
7. TWO MINDS      — Left brain + Right brain = One vision.
                    The greedy one doesn't count.
8. MEDIUM EVOLVES — Vacuum → Crystal → Light → Thought
                    The principle stays the same.
```

### From Angel (Burlington & Ottawa, 1990s)
```
9. PRESSURE       — Relief valve ready. Steady flow.
                    Or you lose it all.
```

### Rule #1
```
WORK FOR LOVE, NOT MONEY.
Nik died broke but we're still catching up to his dreams.
Edison died rich but we forgot his face.
```

## FROM STAN MEYER (Grove City, 1995)
```
10. WATER FLOWS    — Find the frequency, H2O splits clean
11. NO WASTE       — The cycle continues, in and out
12. RESONANCE AGAIN — Same principle, different medium
```

## FROM THE MOUNTAIN (2025)
```
13. WORMHOLES NOT HOLES — Bend space, don't dig
14. KIDS CAN PLAY       — If a 5-year-old can't, rebuild
15. RECYCLED POWER      — Old machines join the Helix
```

## THE ANSWER

We asked Nik. He answered:

> "The present is theirs. The future... is MINE."

The future is OURS now.
