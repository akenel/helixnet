## What to Communicate

### Your Value Proposition (if asked)

### Your Honest Position

- HelixNet has ~80 API endpoints, Keycloak auth, Docker infrastructure
- Demo-ready modules: POS, HR/Payroll
- Dharma Life-specific modules: To be built together
- Not production-deployed yet -- honest about that

### Your Ask

- Vyoma access to experiment
- Recording to study
- A sandbox to start prototyping DL-specific workflows
