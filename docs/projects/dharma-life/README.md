## Open Questions (for Rajiv debrief)

1. What's the biggest bottleneck when onboarding a new state?
2. How does data from WhatsApp groups get into your reporting?
3. When funders ask for impact metrics, what's the manual effort to compile that?
4. What does a DLE's ideal tech experience look like -- if you could dream?
5. Where does SAP fit vs where does the AI platform fit in your vision?
