# 🚂 Release Train — staging → prod promotion ledger

**Why this file exists:** multiple terminals/sessions work on `main` at once, and prod
(`/opt/helixnet`, serves bottega.lapiazza.app) is a divergent `#140` tree many features
behind. We need ONE shared, durable signal for "validated on staging, cleared for prod"
so sessions don't fall over each other or push half-baked work to a live box.

## How it works

1. **The signal = a row marked `APPROVED`.** When Angel signs a feature off on staging,
   flip its **Prod** cell to `APPROVED — Angel, YYYY-MM-DD`. It's in git, so every
   terminal sees it on `git pull`. `STAGED` = on staging, not yet signed off. `PENDING`
   = not on staging yet.
2. **Prod ships as a TRAIN, not per-feature.** One deploy event promotes ALL `APPROVED`
   rows together. (Often forced anyway: features entangle in shared files — e.g. the
   feedback handler won't even import in prod without the cash-shift + CRM code.)
3. **One driver at a time.** Before running a train, set the **Status** line below to
   `🚦 DEPLOYING — <who/session> — <time>`. Others wait until it's back to `🟢 IDLE`.
4. **A train also RECONCILES the prod tree.** Prod is behind by design; the train brings
   prod's Banco files up to the agreed `main` SHA, deploys, smoke-tests, then marks the
   shipped rows `SHIPPED — <sha> — YYYY-MM-DD`.

## Status

`🟢 IDLE` — no train running.

## Caveat — prod is NOT a live Banco POS yet

The prod box runs the **Bottega Compute Exchange** (bottega.lapiazza.app). There is no
live `banco.lapiazza.app` serving real cashiers; **staging-banco is the Banco env**, and
going live is a *shop promotion* (staging sandbox → prod), not just a file copy. So a
Banco prod train is also the moment we stand up Banco on prod — treat it as a real
release, not a hotfix. Read [[deploy-topology-bottega-vs-borrowhood]] +
[[borrowhood-box-divergence]] before driving one.
