# What Is HelixNet?

*A simple explanation for busy people.*

## The Short Version

**HelixNet is a cash register system you own forever.**

No monthly fees. No surprise charges. Your data stays with you.

## The Problem It Solves

| The Old Way | The HelixNet Way |
|-------------|------------------|
| Pay CHF 50-100/month forever | Pay once (or free if you set it up) |
| Company owns your sales data | YOU own your sales data |
| They change prices, you pay | You control everything |
| Internet down = can't sell | Works offline too |
| Need IT consultant for changes | Community helps each other |

## What Can It Do?

```

## How Does It Work?

Think of it like a recipe book:

```
INGREDIENTS (all free):
├─ A computer (you probably have one)
├─ Free software (we provide it)
└─ 30 minutes to set up

RESULT:
└─ A cash register that belongs to you
```

You don't need to understand the technology.
You just need to follow the steps.

## Who Is It For?

**Perfect for:**
- Small shops (1-5 people)
- Pop-up stores
- Market stands
- Cafes
- Anyone tired of monthly software fees

**Not for:**
- Big chains (they have IT departments)
- People who want someone else to handle everything

---

## What Does It Cost?

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| The software | Free (open source) |
| Your time to set up | ~30 minutes |
| A computer to run it | You probably have one |
| Monthly fees | CHF 0. Forever. |

**Optional:** Pay someone to set it up for you if you don't want to do it yourself.

## The Catch?

There's no catch. But here's the honest truth:

```
YOU GET:                    YOU GIVE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Free software               30 min setup time
No monthly fees             Learning something new
Own your data               Asking for help sometimes
Full control                Taking responsibility
```

---

## One More Thing

This isn't a big company product.

It's built by a small community of people who believe:

> *"Solo operators deserve good tools too."*

You can use it, change it, share it.

No permission needed.

We'll show you:
1. How Pam scans a product
2. How she takes payment
3. How the receipt prints

No pressure. Easy.
