## THE BOTTOM LINE

```
CHF 150,000  vs  CHF 732,000
    (5 years)       (5 years)

    HELIX            SAP

    YOU OWN IT       THEY OWN YOU
```

## THREE PATHS

| Path | Year 1 | 5-Year Total | Time to Live | Who Controls |
|------|--------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **HELIX** | CHF 30K | CHF 150K | 90 days | **YOU** |
| **ODOO** | CHF 65K | CHF 250K | 4 months | Mostly you |
| **SAP** | CHF 300K | CHF 732K | 12-18 months | SAP + Accenture |

## WHAT WORKS TODAY

```
7,383 products     LIVE
Pam can sell       LIVE
Ralph sees reports LIVE
Backup runs daily  LIVE
FourTwenty syncs   LIVE
```

**3-week fix list:** SSL certs, credential cleanup, search bug, rate limits.

## THE 98% ARGUMENT

Wilhelm Tell didn't bow to Habsburg hats.

We don't bow to SaaS subscriptions.

> *"They put hats on poles and call them enterprise licenses."*

HelixNet is the crossbow. You aim it. You own it.

## RISK COMPARISON

| If This Fails... | HelixNet | SAP |
|------------------|----------|-----|
| Money lost | CHF 50K | CHF 300K+ |
| Recovery time | 3 months | 12+ months |
| Can still go SAP? | Yes | N/A |
| Political damage | Minimal | Significant |

**Asymmetric risk.** Helix failure is recoverable. SAP failure is catastrophic.

---

## THE TEAM

| Who | Role | Ready? |
|-----|------|--------|
| Sally | Admin + Daily ops | Training: 1 week |
| Vibers | Code + Maintain | Already Docker-fluent |
| Flunky | Architect + Handoff | Documenting everything |
| Leo | AI Assistant | 24/7, no vacation |

**Bus factor:** Covered. Documentation exists. AI can maintain.

## RECOMMENDATION

```
December 2025    Fix critical issues (CHF 10K)
January 2026     Sally trained, stable (CHF 10K)
February 2026    Demo ready, evaluate (CHF 10K)
March 2026       DECISION POINT

If working  -->  Continue + ISO prep
If not      -->  Odoo migration (Plan B ready)
```

**Total risk:** CHF 30K to prove it. Not CHF 300K to hope.

## ONE SENTENCE

> *"Try the crossbow first. You can always buy the cannon later.
> You can never un-buy the cannon."*
