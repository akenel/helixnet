# LEO LEGO EXPLAINS: HelixNet for Humans

*For Cornelia, and anyone who wants to understand what we build*

**The Rule:** If a 5-year-old can't understand it, you're building it wrong.

---

## What Is HelixNet?

Imagine a BIG LEGO SET for running a business.

- The **instruction book** = tells the story
- The **colored pieces** = the parts (orders, shipments, invoices)
- The **LEGO people** = the characters who do the work

We build LEGO that the computer remembers.

---

## The Little LEGO People (Our Characters)

Every LEGO set needs people. Here are ours:

| Person | Job | What They Do |
|--------|-----|--------------|
| YUKI | The Boss Lady | Plans shipments, coordinates everything |
| CHARLIE | The Watcher | Sees everything, catches problems |
| Ka-MAKI | The Paper Guy | Does customs paperwork |
| DIRK | The Mover | Drives trucks, delivers boxes |
| HANK | The Stamper | Approves things (YES or NO) |
| MARCO | The Builder | Puts equipment together |
| MOLLY | The Farmer | Grows food, makes salads |
| FELIX | The Scientist | Tests food in the lab |
| SAL | The Coffee Guy | Makes the best coffee, finds rare parts |

Now the computer knows WHO does WHAT.

## A Story: The Ship With Three Boxes

### The Setup

We ordered THREE things from Japan:

```
+---------------+
|  BOX 1        |  Pretty torch lighters
|  "TORCHES"    |  Going to: THE FISH STORE
+---------------+

+---------------+
|  BOX 2        |  More lighters (lots!)
|  "LIGHTERS"   |  Going to: TWO PLACES (split!)
+---------------+

+---------------+
|  BOX 3        |  Big spinning science thing
|  "SPINNY"     |  Going to: FELIX'S LAB
|  FRAGILE!     |  (Very expensive!)
+---------------+
```

### The Adventure

**Page 1:** YUKI says "Let's order stuff from Japan!"

**Page 2:** Everything goes in ONE big ship container

**Page 3:** CHARLIE climbs INSIDE to watch the expensive spinny thing

**Page 4:** Ship goes on the ocean... 45 days!

**Page 5:** CHARLIE looks at papers... "HEY WAIT!"

> "We forgot a paper! The paper that says the spinny thing is allowed in Switzerland!"

**Page 6:** CHARLIE calls YUKI. YUKI calls Ka-MAKI.

**Page 7:** Ka-MAKI finds the paper. PHEW!

**THE END** (for now...)

## What The Computer Learned

Before: Computer had LEGO pieces but NO INSTRUCTIONS.

After: Computer knows:

1. **WHO** the people are (the LEGO people)
2. **WHAT** boxes are in the ship
3. **WHERE** each box goes
4. **WHAT** went wrong (missing paper!)
5. **WHO** fixed it (CHARLIE saw, Ka-MAKI fixed)

---

## The Magic Part

You can now ask the computer:

> "Hey computer, where is the SPINNY THING?"

And it says:

> "It's in the ship! CHARLIE is watching it! There was a missing paper but Ka-MAKI is fixing it!"

**THE COMPUTER TELLS THE STORY BACK TO US!**

## Why Grown-Ups Make It Hard

| Grown-Up Words | LEGO Words |
|----------------|------------|
| "Freight Coordinator" | The Boss Lady |
| "Supply Chain" | Ship brings boxes |
| "Customs Clearance" | Paper says OK |
| "Consolidated Shipment" | All boxes in one ship |
| "UAT Test Case" | Does the story work? |
| "Database" | Computer's memory |
| "API" | How to ask the computer |

Grown-ups make it complicated. We make it LEGO.

---

## How We Work

```
ANGEL types: "ship has torches and spinny thing"

       (magic happens)

LEO makes: LEGO instructions the computer can read!
```

1. Angel tells the **STORY**
2. Leo builds the **LEGO**
3. Computer **REMEMBERS** the story
4. **ANYONE** can understand it

---

## The Secret

Normal computer people: Spend WEEKS writing instructions nobody reads.

Us: Tell a story, build LEGO, computer learns, DONE before dinner.

---

## For Cornelia

This is what Angel and Leo do:

- We tell stories about people doing jobs
- The computer learns the stories
- Then the computer can answer questions
- Like a very smart notebook that never forgets

**That's it!**

No fancy words needed. Just LEGO.
