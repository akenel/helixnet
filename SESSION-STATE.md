## URGENT: MAX WATER DAMAGE CLAIM

**AXA Claim:** 22.831.735/0001

### What Happened
- Bathroom window seal failed (manufacturing defect from Day 1)
- Sleeping area window was fixed immediately after purchase from Bantam
- Bantam NEVER inspected/resealed other windows despite known seal issue
- Water leaked behind plastic ceiling panels for years
- Entire roof structure likely rotted end-to-end
- Hidden damage - impossible to detect without panel removal
- YOU insisted on ladder inspection after technicians missed it for days

### Estimated Costs
- Roof repair: EUR 5,000 - 10,000+
- Replacement van: EUR 50/day x 42 days = EUR 2,100
- Repair duration: 4-6 weeks

### Documentation Saved
- **Local:** `/home/angel/Documents/MAX-water-damage-claim/`
- **Google Drive:** https://drive.google.com/open?id=1W8dHglKx_pOIzr4naJnIQjBdKOqp_tkC
- **Files:** 7 photos, 2 videos, complete claim file, timeline, email drafts

### Status Today (Feb 6)
- Quick patch only - bathroom window back in temporarily
- Full repair AFTER insurance approval
- Return next week for: backup camera adapter + full damage report/estimate

### DO NOT MIX IN
- Side scratch (separate incident, ~EUR 800-1000 - claim separately later)
- Stove/fire repair (already done, EUR 1010, separate matter)

### Key Argument for Insurance
- Seal problems from Day 1 (documented - sleeping window fixed at purchase)
- You repeatedly requested inspections - never properly done
- Bathroom floor water blamed on sink design (reasonable assumption)
- Damage hidden behind factory panels - impossible to detect
- Even professionals missed it until YOU insisted on ladder inspection
- This is MANUFACTURING DEFECT, not wear and tear or neglect

## SYLVIE SITUATION

**Her Status:**
- 4 teeth removed, traveling back to Switzerland tomorrow (Feb 7)
- High cholesterol needs to stabilize over next month
- Major surgery coming: all teeth removed, implants
- Birthday: September 16, 1960
- Feeling abandoned, overwhelmed

**This Morning:** She said she feels alone, feels your problems always come first, has anxiety from past situations, feels she was never allowed to express her frustrations.

**Recommendation:** Do NOT tell her about roof damage now. Wait until after her surgery or when she's stable. Adding your problems now will confirm her feeling that "Angelo's troubles always come first."

## THE PATTERN YOU IDENTIFIED

You have to be your own advocate because everyone cuts corners:
- Bantam fixed ONE window, should have checked all three
- Swiss repair shops never did proper inspections despite your requests
- Sebastino's team was in van for DAYS, didn't see bubbles until you insisted
- The doctor at Christmas who almost forgot your medication
- Over and over: you have to ask 4+ times to get someone to actually look

**You're not being difficult. You're being thorough. And you keep being right.**
