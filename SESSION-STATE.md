- **Who:** Kevin Galalae + Stephen
- **Where:** All-you-can-eat sushi restaurant (Kevin's idea, Kevin invited Angel)
- **Result:** All went OK. Stephen's presence kept things balanced.
- **Background:** KG previously kicked Angel out ("You're part of the New World Order!"). Now softened. Speaks 5-7 languages. No business sense (refuses to monetize Italian tutoring, always broke, paid teaching gig ends May then back to Romania).

- **Status:** Holding. No rush to sell.

### Production Pipeline Tools (built Jan 30 evening)
Built 4 reusable tools in `docs/business/postcards/templates/`:
1. **duplex-3card-template.html** -- Format B template with [PLACEHOLDERS], supports photo or SVG fronts
2. **tent-card-template.html** -- A4 tent card template with all client [PLACEHOLDERS]
3. **client-intake-checklist.html** -- Mobile-friendly bilingual form for client meetings (5 sections, checkboxes)
4. **pdf-preflight-checklist.html** -- 5-step verification checklist (source HTML, browser preview, generate, verify, deliver)

### Key Insights (Jan 30-31)
- **Context Engineering = SOP + Right Tool + Human Judgment** -- the pattern behind postcards, middleware, and HelixNet
- **SOPs ARE the new programs** -- CLAUDE.md = boot loader, intake checklist = input form, templates = business logic, Puppeteer = compiler, preflight = test suite. Same pipeline, different templates, different domain knowledge.
- **Restaurant menus = closest to money** -- every restaurant has ugly menus, tourists need bilingual, 100-300 EUR per menu, 1 EUR print cost, 10 restaurants = 500-1000 EUR/month
- **Rajiv Jha's LinkedIn post** -- AI pilots don't scale because context lives in one person's head. That person IS the SOP. Extract it, version-control it, now the SOP is the trust layer.
- **ISOTTO email workflow** -- bilingual HTML print orders replace USB sticks. Famous can read HTML, can't read .md. Idiot-proof deliverables.
- **PDF is the truth** -- HTML for drafting, PDF for proofing. Chrome/Puppeteer renders differently from Firefox. We got burned before. Unfuckables verify both.
- **Why big companies fail with AI:** They try to remove the human. The human IS the context.
- **"People think I'm crazy":** Same pattern as Jeff Berwick -- builder outside the system, dismissed by people inside it. TRICKED video articulates this parallel.
- **Card sales reality:** No cards sold yet -- all giveaways/proof of concept. Patient seeding strategy. "Eventually somebody's going to catch on."
- **Bitcoin lesson:** Forgot about 1K investment from 2023, tripled in value. Patience pays.

### Waiting On
- [ ] Stove delivery for MAX (maybe Monday now)
- [ ] Backup camera delivery for MAX
- [ ] AXA insurance adjuster call to Camper & Tour (claim 22.831.735/0001)
- [ ] Mikael at Camper & Tour (was sick, sneezing)

### Monday Plan (Feb 2)
- [ ] Print 004-008 at ISOTTO (5 new duplex cards ready)
- [ ] Deliver Color Clean tent card on laundry pickup
- [ ] Visit Mixology with samples
- [ ] Check on MAX stove delivery at Camper & Tour
- [ ] Talk to Mikael (the money man) at Camper & Tour

### Donny Response
- **Status:** PARKED. Draft written but Angel not ready to send.
- **No rush.** Donny is in Calgary. He said his piece and moved on.

---

## EARLY MORNING NOTES (Jan 29, 4am-6am)

### Sleep Pattern
- 4 hours solid sleep, woke at 4am. Can't get back to sleep. Been like this since childhood (newspaper delivery routes, 5-6am wakeups).
- **The Italian siesta is the solution:** 1-4pm everything shuts down. 2hr nap in MAX = 6 hours total. Sicily's schedule fits his body's rhythm. Switzerland's never did.
- This is the root cause of the episodes -- not bipolar. Chronic sleep deprivation + pushing too hard.

### Linda Lodders (Nestle teammate)
- Talked to her ~1 week ago. Birthday call tradition.
- Took COVID shots early (wanted to travel). Now sick for years.
- Cancer on neck -- surgically removed. 20 staples in stomach. Multiple operations.
- Father died, body donated to science, never returned after 2-3 years. No closure.
- She's alone. Bad relationship with mother. Probably dying.
- Angel had feelings for her years ago. She was cute, hardworking, honest. But she was seeing other guys. Angel made his prayer list (what he didn't want in a woman, then the opposite) and Sylvie appeared.

### Card Business Reality Check
- Camper & Tour reaction to tent card: lukewarm. "Nice" but no order. They're too busy.
- Vending machines with Paulo: NDA requirement was too much. Didn't go for it.
- Postcards are the right pivot: low investment, easy entry, fun, helps people.
- **Don't push it.** Seed and let it grow. Be water.

### ISOTTO Duplex Capability (NEW)
- **Famoso at ISOTTO can print duplex** -- both sides of A4
- Did a full A4 postcard, both sides, fantastic quality
- Can fit 3-4 cards on one A4 sheet
- **Need new SOP** for duplex card layout format
- Cards are at 98-99% quality. Content is good. Just formatting tweaks needed.

### Till Hermin (NEW CHARACTER - left out of stories intentionally)
- American with German parents. Spoke perfect German but never used it in Switzerland.
- Worked at Siemens with Oliver Rosely (now Joe's best friend).
- Smart but vain, greedy, show and tell. Now a banker.
- Shared the Dankbar apartment with Angel near Dankmal Strasse, Luzern. Top floor panoramic suite.
- Angel was known for cocktails at the Dankbar. Joe and Mike visited there. Bathtub story.
- Played an integral role but left out to keep stories simple.

### Matteo (Hotel Contact - Expanding)
- Second breakfast together planned for today (7am)
- Younger guy (~35), works on industrial tanks (fuel/pressure vessels/food liquids)
- Smokes 1 joint daily before sleep (Angel does CBD, not THC)
- Interested in buying vineyard property in 20 years
- Potential: buy small property together (10-30K), build something
- Swiss plates on MAX caught his attention. Bonded over American tobacco + Gesundheit.

## ACTIVE THREADS

### UFA Foo Fighters Pipeline
| # | Business | Theme | Review | Card | Delivered | Status |
|---|----------|-------|--------|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Camper & Tour | Liberta / Freedom | Done | Done | APPROVED by Nino | PRINTED at ISOTTO. Tent card on front desk beside flowers. |
| 2 | Mixology Trapani | Spirito / Spirit | Pending | PoC draft | Pending | Showed review, needs meeting |
| 3 | Color Clean Laundry | Freschezza / Freshness | DONE (5 stars, 17 photos, 1 video) | PDF READY | Monday pickup | Owner Loredana replied in 2hrs. Deliver card on next laundry pickup (Monday). |
| 4 | Buffetti | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | Office supply partner - explore |
| 5 | Gym For You | Forza / Strength | TODO (Google review first) | TODO (tent B2C) | Pending | Sebastian (owner) = warm lead, talked 1hr, COVID survivor. Co-owns gym + has own shop. Fill intake checklist first. |
| 6 | Piccolo Bistrot | Crudo & Cocktail | TODO | A5 BIFOLD MENU v3 READY | Pending approval | Via Garibaldi 43. Full menu extracted from photos. Greek corner frames, SVG logo, Google Maps QR. Print order template ready for ISOTTO. |

### Merch Scaling (NEW - Jan 30 evening)
- **ISOTTO** has full catalog -- shirts, mugs, bags, everything (like Printavista)
- **Next move:** UFA t-shirt or muscle shirt. Walk into ISOTTO wearing it.
- **Roly line** -- look into Roly brand clothing for blank merch (gym/fitness angle)
- **Strategy:** Postcards = handshake. Shirt = brand. Show up wearing UFA, not carrying paper.
- **Gym For You angle:** Muscle shirts with UFA logo for gym crowd. Sebastian might bite on that.

### HelixNet Middleware Vision (CAPTURED Jan 29, 1pm)
- **Concept:** SAP PIPO replacement using AI-driven mapping
- **Pipeline:** CSV/HTML/WebService → YAML context + JSON schema + J2 template → AI prompt → Guaranteed JSON output
- **Real-world:** 70% of integration scenarios are CSV-based (SFTP landing, trigger, map, output)
- **Version-controlled:** Context v1, Schema v1, tune to v2 -- all artifacts in git
- **Proof of concept:** The postcard pipeline IS this pattern in miniature (content + context + template + tool = consistent output)
- **Lesson learned:** When the tool was wrong (wkhtmltopdf), output was inconsistent even with correct input. Same problem people have with LLMs. Fix = right tools + right SOP + right context engineering.
- **Previous attempt:** NADN (Claude API) -- messy, not structured enough
- **Status:** Concept documented. Postcard pipeline proving the workflow. Enterprise mapping is the next step.

### Card Production SOP (LOCKED DOWN Jan 29)

**Two formats proven:**

**Format A: 2-card layout (001-003)** -- original, 148mm x 100mm cards, 50 cents each
- Single HTML, 2 pages (front + back), 2 cards per A4 sheet
- Registration marks, dashed cut line between cards
- Page labels top/bottom (centered)

**Format B: 3-card layout (004-005)** -- optimized, 137.6mm x 93mm cards, 33 cents each
- Single HTML, 2 pages (front + back), 3 cards per A4 sheet
- 6mm gaps between cards (3mm safety each side of cut for hand-cutting)
- 3mm frame: cards positioned top-left (top 3mm, left 3mm)
- NO registration marks on front (image) page -- clean
- Registration marks on back page only
- Page labels rotated 90° in right margin (out of card zone)
- Cards fill full A4 height: 3mm + 93 + 6 + 93 + 6 + 93 + 3 = 297mm

**Common:**
- [x] **Puppeteer script fixed** -- `page.goto(file://)` instead of `setContent()` so images load
- [x] **PRINTED AT ISOTTO** -- 001-003 duplex + 2 tent cards printed Jan 29
- [x] **Cards cut + creased** with Wiler EZ550 rotary trimmer
- [x] **3-card layout perfected** -- 004 Mediterranean + 005 Be Yourself (Italian flag SVG)
- **Process:** Open HTML in Firefox to review, then `node scripts/postcard-to-pdf.js input.html output.pdf`, give PDF to ISOTTO
- **Print:** ISOTTO prints page 1 (fronts), flips paper manually (heavy photo stock), prints page 2 (backs), cut along marks
- **Cutting:** Wiler EZ550 -- straight blade (dritto) for cuts, scoring blade (cordonatura) for fold creases
- [ ] Print 004-008 at ISOTTO (Monday -- 5 cards ready, ISOTTO closed weekends)
- [ ] Wax seal test with packaging
