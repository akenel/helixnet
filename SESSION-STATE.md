## TODAY - JAN 30, 2026 (Recovery Day)

### Health
- [x] Rough night: diarrhea at 12am, 3:25am, up at 6:21am
- [x] Sugar water + crackers at 3:30am
- [x] Slept 8am-9:20am, showered
- [x] Pharmacy: Imodium 2mg + Prolife 10 Forte (probiotics + B vitamins)
- [x] Camomilla tea + Galbusera crackers
- [x] Visited Camper & Tour -- stove not arrived, maybe Monday
- [x] Hotel booked through Monday night
- [x] Sleeping on and off -- Imodium causes drowsiness
- [ ] Keep hydrating, small meals (plain bread, crackers, pasta in bianco)
- [ ] Prolife: 1 capsule per day to rebuild gut

### Work (from bed)
- [x] Downloaded: Trump/Starmer interview + China sells US debt video + AI replacing developers video
- [x] SESSION-STATE updated
- [x] Voice memos transcribed (3 messages -- product photos, middleware vision, context engineering philosophy)
- [x] Reviewed finished product photos: 3 duplex postcards + 2 tent cards (Mixology + Camper & Tour)
- [x] Researched Sylvie's Ecolution Etsy shop -- 673 five-star reviews, wool felt + Tuscan leather, est. 2010
- [x] World news research: Iran massacres (5,700-36,500 dead), China selling US debt (9 months, $682B), US armada
- [x] Financial position assessment: 600K apartment, 15K mortgage, 50K cash, 300K pension (locked till 63)
- [ ] Post Color Clean Google review (text drafted, photos from phone)
- [ ] **NEXT: Print 004 + 005 at ISOTTO** (when feeling better)
- [ ] **NEXT: Visit Mixology** -- show samples, pitch collection
- [ ] Wax seal test + mail Donny's card
- [ ] Explore Sozialhilfe (Gemeinde) when back in Switzerland for cashflow bridge

### Key Insights (Jan 30 afternoon conversation)
- **Context Engineering = SOP + Right Tool + Human Judgment** -- the pattern behind postcards, middleware, and HelixNet
- **Why big companies fail with AI:** They try to remove the human. The human IS the context.
- **Pharmacy HTML cheat sheet** = context engineering in real life (structured info, right format, right language, right moment)
- **Financial position is strong** -- asset-rich, income-poor. Solvable. Don't pay off 15K mortgage (Sylvie is right).
- **Ecolution + UFA** = two proven product lines (her: wool/leather, him: postcards/consulting)
- **Famoso at ISOTTO** asked what software Angel uses -- "I wrote my own." That's the pitch.

### Yesterday - JAN 29, 2026 (completed)
- [x] 3-card layout perfected -- 004 Mediterranean + 005 Be Yourself (Italian flag SVG)
- [x] ISOTTO print run -- 3 duplex sheets + 2 tent cards (~5 EUR)
- [x] Cards cut + creased with Wiler EZ550
- [x] wkhtmltopdf killed, Puppeteer locked, all SOPs updated
- [x] Committed + pushed: `81f01df` (89 files, 15,579 insertions)

### Waiting On
- [ ] Stove delivery for MAX (maybe Monday now)
- [ ] Backup camera delivery for MAX
- [ ] AXA insurance adjuster call to Camper & Tour (claim 22.831.735/0001)
- [ ] Mikael at Camper & Tour (wasn't there yesterday)

### Ready to Execute (TODAY)

- [ ] **Mixology visit** -- show tent card + duplex samples, pitch collection idea
- [ ] Post Google review for Color Clean (photos ready)
- [ ] Print Color Clean tent card at ISOTTO (PDF ready)
- [ ] Deliver Color Clean card on laundry pickup

### Donny Response
- **Status:** PARKED. Draft written but Angel not ready to send. Not in the right headspace.
- **Draft saved in chat.** Short, warm, human. No rebuttal.
- **Decision:** Don't respond today. Let it sit. When the moment is right, maybe just 3 lines: "Dan. I heard you. I love you too. Give Victoria a hug from her uncle."
- **No rush.** Donny is in Calgary, 8 hours behind. He said his piece and moved on.

---

## EARLY MORNING NOTES (Jan 29, 4am-6am)

### Sleep Pattern
- 4 hours solid sleep, woke at 4am. Can't get back to sleep. Been like this since childhood (newspaper delivery routes, 5-6am wakeups).
- **The Italian siesta is the solution:** 1-4pm everything shuts down. 2hr nap in MAX = 6 hours total. Sicily's schedule fits his body's rhythm. Switzerland's never did.
- This is the root cause of the episodes -- not bipolar. Chronic sleep deprivation + pushing too hard.

### Linda Lodders (Nestle teammate)
- Talked to her ~1 week ago. Birthday call tradition.
- Took COVID shots early (wanted to travel). Now sick for years.
- Cancer on neck -- surgically removed. 20 staples in stomach. Multiple operations.
- Father died, body donated to science, never returned after 2-3 years. No closure.
- She's alone. Bad relationship with mother. Probably dying.
- Angel had feelings for her years ago. She was cute, hardworking, honest. But she was seeing other guys. Angel made his prayer list (what he didn't want in a woman, then the opposite) and Sylvie appeared.

### Card Business Reality Check
- Camper & Tour reaction to tent card: lukewarm. "Nice" but no order. They're too busy.
- Vending machines with Paulo: NDA requirement was too much. Didn't go for it.
- Postcards are the right pivot: low investment, easy entry, fun, helps people.
- **Don't push it.** Seed and let it grow. Be water.

### ISOTTO Duplex Capability (NEW)
- **Famoso at ISOTTO can print duplex** -- both sides of A4
- Did a full A4 postcard, both sides, fantastic quality
- Can fit 3-4 cards on one A4 sheet
- **Need new SOP** for duplex card layout format
- Cards are at 98-99% quality. Content is good. Just formatting tweaks needed.

### Till Hermin (NEW CHARACTER - left out of stories intentionally)
- American with German parents. Spoke perfect German but never used it in Switzerland.
- Worked at Siemens with Oliver Rosely (now Joe's best friend).
- Smart but vain, greedy, show and tell. Now a banker.
- Shared the Dankbar apartment with Angel near Dankmal Strasse, Luzern. Top floor panoramic suite.
- Angel was known for cocktails at the Dankbar. Joe and Mike visited there. Bathtub story.
- Played an integral role but left out to keep stories simple.

### Matteo (Hotel Contact - Expanding)
- Second breakfast together planned for today (7am)
- Younger guy (~35), works on industrial tanks (fuel/pressure vessels/food liquids)
- Smokes 1 joint daily before sleep (Angel does CBD, not THC)
- Interested in buying vineyard property in 20 years
- Potential: buy small property together (10-30K), build something
- Swiss plates on MAX caught his attention. Bonded over American tobacco + Gesundheit.

## ACTIVE THREADS

### UFA Foo Fighters Pipeline
| # | Business | Theme | Review | Card | Delivered | Status |
|---|----------|-------|--------|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Camper & Tour | Liberta / Freedom | Done | Done | APPROVED by Nino | PRINTED at ISOTTO |
| 2 | Mixology Trapani | Spirito / Spirit | Pending | PoC draft | Pending | Showed review, needs meeting |
| 3 | Color Clean Laundry | Freschezza / Freshness | NEXT (photos ready) | PDF READY | On pickup | Review first, card on pickup |
| 4 | Buffetti | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | Office supply partner - explore |

### HelixNet Middleware Vision (CAPTURED Jan 29, 1pm)
- **Concept:** SAP PIPO replacement using AI-driven mapping
- **Pipeline:** CSV/HTML/WebService → YAML context + JSON schema + J2 template → AI prompt → Guaranteed JSON output
- **Real-world:** 70% of integration scenarios are CSV-based (SFTP landing, trigger, map, output)
- **Version-controlled:** Context v1, Schema v1, tune to v2 -- all artifacts in git
- **Proof of concept:** The postcard pipeline IS this pattern in miniature (content + context + template + tool = consistent output)
- **Lesson learned:** When the tool was wrong (wkhtmltopdf), output was inconsistent even with correct input. Same problem people have with LLMs. Fix = right tools + right SOP + right context engineering.
- **Previous attempt:** NADN (Claude API) -- messy, not structured enough
- **Status:** Concept documented. Postcard pipeline proving the workflow. Enterprise mapping is the next step.

### Card Production SOP (LOCKED DOWN Jan 29)

**Two formats proven:**

**Format A: 2-card layout (001-003)** -- original, 148mm x 100mm cards, 50 cents each
- Single HTML, 2 pages (front + back), 2 cards per A4 sheet
- Registration marks, dashed cut line between cards
- Page labels top/bottom (centered)

**Format B: 3-card layout (004-005)** -- optimized, 137.6mm x 93mm cards, 33 cents each
- Single HTML, 2 pages (front + back), 3 cards per A4 sheet
- 6mm gaps between cards (3mm safety each side of cut for hand-cutting)
- 3mm frame: cards positioned top-left (top 3mm, left 3mm)
- NO registration marks on front (image) page -- clean
- Registration marks on back page only
- Page labels rotated 90° in right margin (out of card zone)
- Cards fill full A4 height: 3mm + 93 + 6 + 93 + 6 + 93 + 3 = 297mm

**Common:**
- [x] **Puppeteer script fixed** -- `page.goto(file://)` instead of `setContent()` so images load
- [x] **PRINTED AT ISOTTO** -- 001-003 duplex + 2 tent cards printed Jan 29
- [x] **Cards cut + creased** with Wiler EZ550 rotary trimmer
- [x] **3-card layout perfected** -- 004 Mediterranean + 005 Be Yourself (Italian flag SVG)
- **Process:** Open HTML in Firefox to review, then `node scripts/postcard-to-pdf.js input.html output.pdf`, give PDF to ISOTTO
- **Print:** ISOTTO prints page 1 (fronts), flips paper manually (heavy photo stock), prints page 2 (backs), cut along marks
- **Cutting:** Wiler EZ550 -- straight blade (dritto) for cuts, scoring blade (cordonatura) for fold creases
- [ ] Print 004 + 005 at ISOTTO (next run)
- [ ] Wax seal test with packaging
