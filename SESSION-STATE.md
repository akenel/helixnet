## URGENT: MAX WATER DAMAGE CLAIM

**AXA Claim:** 22.831.735/0001

### Timeline (CORRECT)

**Original Issue:** Stove fire/smoke damage (separate from water damage)

**Late Jan / Early Feb 2026:**
- Van at Camper & Tour for stove replacement + smoke damage cleanup
- Angel staying at PuntaTipa Hotel during repairs
- Technicians cleaned EVERY MILLIMETER of van interior for smoke damage
- Bubbles visible in ceiling during cleaning - NO ONE said anything

**Thursday Feb 5:**
- Stove work COMPLETED - van clean, A1 condition
- Angel left PuntaTipa Hotel (morning)
- Angel paid EUR 1,010 for stove repair
- Now living in camper van again at Camper & Tour

**Friday Feb 6 (TODAY):**
- Returned to Camper & Tour for backup camera installation
- Asked AGAIN about bathroom window seal (had suspected issue)
- Technicians initially dismissed it
- Angel INSISTED on ladder inspection at roof level
- Bathroom window seal found COMPLETELY FAILED
- Panels removed - extensive hidden water damage revealed
- NOW technicians point to ceiling bubbles: "See? Water damage"
- Same bubbles they saw during smoke cleaning and said nothing

### The GOLD Observation
When they cleaned every surface for smoke damage, they saw bubbles in the ceiling and said nothing. Today after finding water damage, they point to SAME bubbles as evidence. This proves:
1. Evidence was visible during cleaning
2. Professionals didn't connect the dots
3. Damage was truly hidden/non-obvious
4. NOT policyholder negligence

### What Happened (Root Cause)
- Bathroom window seal failed (manufacturing defect from Day 1)
- Sleeping area window was fixed immediately after purchase from Bantam
- Bantam NEVER inspected/resealed other windows despite known seal issue
- Water leaked behind plastic ceiling panels for years
- Entire roof structure likely rotted end-to-end
- Hidden damage - impossible to detect without panel removal

### Estimated Costs (Water Damage - Pending)
- Roof repair: EUR 5,000 - 10,000+
- Replacement van: EUR 50/day x 42 days = EUR 2,100
- Repair duration: 4-6 weeks

### Expenses to Claim
- [x] Stove repair: EUR 1,010 (PAID Feb 5)
- [ ] PuntaTipa Hotel nights (submit receipts - ask AXA where)
- [ ] Water damage repair (estimate pending next week)

### Documentation Saved
- **Local:** `/home/angel/Documents/MAX-water-damage-claim/`
- **Google Drive:** https://drive.google.com/open?id=1W8dHglKx_pOIzr4naJnIQjBdKOqp_tkC
- **Files:** 7 photos, 2 videos, complete claim file, timeline, email drafts

### Status Today (Feb 6)
- Stove repair: COMPLETE, PAID
- Water damage: Quick patch only - bathroom window back in temporarily
- Full water damage repair AFTER insurance approval
- Return next week for: backup camera adapter + full damage report/estimate

### DO NOT MIX IN
- Side scratch (separate incident, ~EUR 800-1000 - claim separately later)

### Key Arguments for Insurance
- Seal problems from Day 1 (documented - sleeping window fixed at purchase)
- You repeatedly requested inspections - never properly done
- Bathroom floor water blamed on sink design (reasonable assumption)
- Damage hidden behind factory panels - impossible to detect
- Professionals cleaned entire van, saw bubbles, said nothing
- Even professionals missed it until YOU insisted on ladder inspection
- This is MANUFACTURING DEFECT, not wear and tear or neglect

## SYLVIE SITUATION

**Her Status:**
- 4 teeth removed, traveling back to Switzerland tomorrow (Feb 7)
- High cholesterol needs to stabilize over next month
- Major surgery coming: all teeth removed, implants
- Birthday: September 16, 1960
- Feeling abandoned, overwhelmed

**This Morning:** She said she feels alone, feels your problems always come first, has anxiety from past situations, feels she was never allowed to express her frustrations.

**Recommendation:** Do NOT tell her about roof damage now. Wait until after her surgery or when she's stable. Adding your problems now will confirm her feeling that "Angelo's troubles always come first."

## THE PATTERN YOU IDENTIFIED

You have to be your own advocate because everyone cuts corners:
- Bantam fixed ONE window, should have checked all three
- Swiss repair shops never did proper inspections despite your requests
- Technicians cleaned EVERY MILLIMETER for smoke damage, saw ceiling bubbles, said nothing
- Same technicians NOW point to bubbles: "See? Water damage!" - only after YOU insisted on inspection
- The doctor at Christmas who almost forgot your medication
- Over and over: you have to ask 4+ times to get someone to actually look

**You're not being difficult. You're being thorough. And you keep being right.**

**The Bubble Lesson:** Evidence can be in plain sight. Professionals see it and don't connect the dots. You have to ask the right questions AND insist on the right inspections.
