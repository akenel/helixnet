# 🐑 PURPLE SHEEP RISING — Episode 2, Scene 1

*~350 words | The Farm | Ms. Lee's Domain | The Telegram*

---

**LEE-VILLE — THE FARM — 10:00 AM LOCAL**

Morning dew on the grass. Sun rising over the mountains.

Purple sheep dotted the hillside. Baaa. Baaa. Little lambs stumbling through the wet grass.

This was Ms. Lee's domain.

---

**THE FARMHOUSE — OUTDOOR BATH**

Steam rose from the wooden tub. CBD bubble bath. Deep cleaning rejuvenation oils.

Bruce floated. Eyes closed.

Ms. Lee stood behind him. Pouring warm oil over his shoulders. Slow circles.

"You're tense, baby."

"I'm thinking."

"About money?"

"Always."

She worked the coco CBD tanning butter into his back. The scratches from Spain were healing. Whatever happened in Barcelona... stayed in Barcelona.

---

Bruce could hear it. The dew. Evaporating in the morning sun.

Drip. Drip.

The right temperature. The right pressure. Everything in balance.

"Baby, I need to go to the shops."

Ms. Lee's hands paused. "Now?"

"I got some new ideas. Need to call Felix. It's almost lunch time in Switzerland."

"Daylight savings too?"

"Some days."

She resumed the massage. "You're always thinking."

"That's how we got the sheep."

She smiled. Purple sheep. Her idea. His money. Their empire.

Bruce reached for his phone. Waterproof case. Started texting.

```
TELEGRAM — FELIX

Bruce: Felix. Did anyone buy the MS LEE grinder?

Felix: The collector piece? Not yet. Why?

Bruce: I need to meet that buyer.

Felix: Why?

Bruce: So they know it's really me.

Felix: ...

Bruce: Video call. I can prove it.

Felix: Bruce. Are you saying...

Bruce: I'm THE Bruce.

Felix: The Bruce Lee?

Bruce: The water. The dragon. The grinder.

Felix: 🐉

Bruce: When can we talk?

Felix: I'm at Rosie's getting leather.
       Back at Artemis by 4.

Bruce: I'll call at 4:30. Swiss time.

Felix: I'll be ready.

Bruce: Tell Pam... the dragon flies home.

Ms. Lee watched him type.

"Business?"

"Legacy."

She poured more oil. The sheep baaa'd in the distance.

"The purple ones are pregnant again."

Bruce smiled. Eyes still closed.

"Everything multiplies."
