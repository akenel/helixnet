Pam leaned in. Examined Felix's arm.

"Felix... these aren't scratches."

"What?"

"These are claw marks. And is that... sand?"

Felix looked down. Fragments of Barcelona beach still embedded in his skin.

"I don't remember."

Pam grabbed the CBD tanning butter. Started working it in, gentle circles.

"I know my tats and piercings, Felix. Is this some new technique from Spannabis? The after-hours bars?"

Felix winced. "Something like that."

"Ralph had to cover. We lost contact with you Friday."

"Friday?"

"It's Monday."

*RING.*

Sylvie walked in. Pink details on her jacket. Perfect as always.

"Felix! You look... alive. Barely."

"Thanks, Syl."

Pam grabbed tip money from the jar. "Sylvie, can you get Felix a coffee next door? Double. And something healthy to eat."

"Wait—" Felix raised a hand. "Just coffee. I just restocked the 420 snack bars."

Sylvie nodded. "Double espresso. Got it."

She paused at the door. "Those grinders look amazing, by the way. The dragon ones? Who signed them?"

Pam froze. Looked at the display.

One grinder. There should be two.

"Pam... where's the other one?"

Pam's eyes went wide. "Gessler."

"Gessler was here?"

"He said they felt like water. I thought he was just... looking."

Felix closed his eyes. Deep breath.

"The Black Dragon limited edition. Signed by Bruce Lee. One of twelve in existence. With the Joker and Ms. Lee engraving."

"Felix, I'm so sorry—"

"Worth three nights at Spannabis. All-inclusive. Lifetime CBD. Unlimited tanning butter."

Pam stared. "He took it?"

"Under that hoodie of his? Absolutely."

---

*Sylvie returned with coffee.*

"Why does everyone look like someone died?"

Felix sipped.

"Gessler happened."
