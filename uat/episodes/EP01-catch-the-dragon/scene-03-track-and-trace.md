**EARLIER THAT MORNING — LITTAU**

Gessler flipped the grinder in his palm. Beautiful.

Burt leaned in. "Where'd you get that?"

"Artemis. Walked out with it."

"That's stealing."

"That's redistribution."

Burt examined it. Dragon on one side. Bruce Lee signature. Twelve collector picks engraved around the edge. The Joker and Ms. Lee on the base.

"This is worth something."

"I know. Give me 50 francs."

Burt laughed. "I'll give you 20."

"Done."

**ARTEMIS — 10 MINUTES LATER**

*RING.*

Fabio walked in. Shirt half-buttoned. Tucking it in. Almost tripped.

"Felix! You're back!"

Felix eyed him. "Fabio."

Fabio pulled out the grinder. The Black Dragon.

"Look at this! You ever seen one of these? See this finger effect? Looks like scratches but that's the design. Logos stick perfect on this texture."

Felix said nothing.

"I designed this. Can I make a KB for it? This will sell like waterfalls of money."

Fabio laughed. Sheepish. Eyes shifting.

Pam cleared her throat. "Fabio, have you seen the vending machine?"

"What?"

"10 CHF surprise boxes. 2 for 25. Packed with PAM value. Papers, filters, all sorts. Anonymous purchase. Or use ID for CRACK points."

Fabio's eyes lit up. "Discontinued items?"

"Maybe a winner. 25 franc value. Mini grinders. Secret paper cases. Black, green, pink."

"I'll try my luck."

He shuffled toward the machine. Felix watched him go.

**OUTSIDE — THE MINI COOPER**

Sylvie waited. Camel and cream two-tone. Love Bug vibes.

Felix climbed in. "I forgot the cobra skin samples. Lost them at Spannabis."

"We'll manage."

"Coffee first?"

"Gas first. Then coffee."

---

**GAS STATION — 15 MINUTES LATER**

Sylvie pulled up to the pump.

"Go get the coffees. I'll fill up."

Felix walked in. Approached the machine.

ENTKALKEN.

He tried the next one.

KEINE KAPSELN.

The third.

WARTUNGSMODUS.

He stared. Every machine. Broken.

The attendant shrugged. "Tea or water?"

Felix grabbed two waters. Walked back.

Sylvie looked at him. "No coffee?"

"Switzerland is descaling."
