# 🐉 CATCH THE DRAGON — Episode 1, Scene 4

*~300 words | The Sting | Vending Machine Trap*

**ARTEMIS — VENDING MACHINE CORNER**

Pam watched Fabio fumble with coins.

Ralph appeared behind her. Butter tubes in hand. Day off. But not really.

"Is that the grinder?" Ralph whispered.

"Yep."

"The one Gessler took?"

"Yep."

"The one worth Spannabis for life?"

"Yep."

Ralph set down the butter. "I'm off the clock. But I'm in."

Fabio inserted 10 CHF.

Machine whirred.

B4. SURPRISE BOX.

*Clunk.*

Out dropped: CBD dog treats.

"What the—"

Pam appeared beside him. Sweet smile.

"Bad luck, Fabio. Try again?"

Fabio looked at the grinder in his hand. Then at Pam.

"You know what? I should go."

"But you just started."

Ralph stepped into the doorway. Arms crossed.

"Fabio. Nice grinder."

"I designed it."

"Really? Because it says 'Bruce Lee' on the bottom."

Fabio flipped it. His face fell.

"And '1 of 12' on the edge."

Silence.

"And there's a security camera. Right there."

Fabio looked up. Red light blinking.

**FIVE MINUTES LATER**

Fabio sat on the little stool by the register. Head down.

"I didn't steal it."

"Where'd you get it?"

"Burt."

"Where'd Burt get it?"

"...Gessler."

Pam picked up her phone. Texted Felix.

```
DRAGON RECOVERED.
FABIO SANG.
TRAIL: GESSLER → BURT → FABIO.
WHAT DO?
```

Felix replied:

```
Keep the grinder.
Give Fabio a tea.
Tell him he owes me a KB.
A real one.
```

Pam looked at Fabio.

"Tea?"

"...Please."

"And you're writing a KB. About grinder textures. A real one."

Fabio nodded. Defeated. Relieved.

"Can I still use the vending machine?"

Ralph laughed. "After you pay for that dog treat you pocketed."

Fabio's hand froze in his hoodie.

"...How did you know?"

"Camera, Fabio. Camera."
