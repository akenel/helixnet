# 🐉 CATCH THE DRAGON — Episode 1, Scene 1

*~300 words | Dark Comedy | The Return*

---

The night train from Barcelona lurched. Felix opened his eyes.

Sunny morning. But not Spain. Switzerland. The lake. Mountains. Home.

He checked his pocket. No wallet. Shirt ripped. No ticket.

"Ticket, please."

Felix smiled at the conductor. "I seem to have... misplaced it."

"That will be 180 francs. Cash or card."

No wallet. No card.

"I have... a phone?"

The conductor stared. "TWINT?"

Felix opened the app. Balance: 0.00 CHF.

"There's an ATM in Zurich."

"We're 40 minutes out."

"I'll wait."

---

Zurich Hauptbahnhof. 6:47 AM. ATM rejected his card. Three times.

He called the bank.

"Your account is frozen pending VAT reconciliation."

"What VAT?"

"The Nespresso invoice. There's a... discrepancy."

"How much?"

"Approximately... 10.5 million."

Felix laughed. Then stopped. "That's not mine."

"The system says otherwise."

---

The bus to Luzern. Standing room only. No ticket.

He got off early. Walked. Past Littau. Past the castle. Down the Gasse.

Artemis. The door. The bell.

Pam looked up. "Felix? You look... terrible."

"I lost everything in Spain."

"Everything?"

"Wallet. Ticket. Shirt. Maybe my mind."

"Coffee?"

"Please."

The machine beeped. ENTKALKEN.

Felix stared at it. "Not today."

Pam handed him tea instead.

The door bell rang. Gessler shuffled in. Stopped. Looked at the grinders.

"These new, Pam? Feel like water in my hands. Titanium? No... SS. Where'd you get these?"

"A tourist named Bruce."

Gessler held one up to the light. "22 francs? These will fly. Put them up front."

He shuffled out. Paused at the door.

"Nice shirt, Felix. Ripped looks good on you."

*Ciao.*
