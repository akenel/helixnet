# PAM ATTACK #003 — The Gessler Return Policy Gambit

## Setup
End of day. Pam is tired. Door bell rings.
Gessler shuffles in with a plastic bag.

## The Attack
1. Gessler: "I want to return this."
2. Pam: "Sure, do you have a receipt?"
3. Gessler: "No, but I bought it here."
4. Pam: *looks at pipe* "Sir, this is chipped."
5. Gessler: "It was like that when I bought it."
6. Pam: "When did you buy it?"
7. Gessler: "...Yesterday."
8. Pam: *checks system* "Sir, we were closed yesterday."
9. Gessler: "I meant... the day before."
10. Pam: *checks* "That was Sunday. Also closed."
11. Gessler: "Time is... flexible."
12. Pam: "Sir, this pipe has 'BlowUp' etched on the bottom."
13. Gessler: "..."
14. Pam: "BlowUp is next door."
15. Gessler: "...Maybe I got confused."
16. Pam: "Sir, do you need... help? Water? A chair?"
17. Gessler: "Do you have 3 francs for flints?"
18. Pam: *sighs* "Felix keeps a jar by the register..."
19. Gessler: "Bless you, Pamela."
20. Pam: "...How do you know my full name?"
21. Gessler: *already leaving* "The wind told me."
