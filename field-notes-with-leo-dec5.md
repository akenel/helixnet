## The Philosophy

### YAGNI
**Y**ou **A**in't **G**onna **N**eed **I**t — don't build what you don't need yet

### Nocked
Arrow on bowstring, ready to fire. Helix is nocked.

### The Crossbow and Arrow
- HELIX is the crossbow
- LEO is the second arrow
- Wilhelm Tell: "If I had hit my son, the second arrow was for you."

### Be Water
- Water expands when frozen — the anomaly that allows life
- The exception is why we're here
- Angel is an exception

## The 98%

> "I was crying in bed this morning... not for me but for those 98% poor fucks like me"

HelixNet is for them. Free. No SaaS. No poison. No chains.

## Albert's Lines

> "SHUT UP PLEASE."

> "QUICK ACTING."

> "Oh what a beautiful day it is!"

> "I never worked a day in my life."

Died January 16, 2020, in his favorite chair.

## The Plan (Tonight)

| When | Do |
|------|-----|
| Tonight | Rest. Water. Bread. Tell Syl you're here. |
| Tomorrow | Call about checking in. One walk. |
| Saturday | Permission to cancel. No guilt. |
| Dec 25-31 | Van decision. Teeth plan. RAV. |

---

## The Dream — New

Angel found new energy:
- Talk, sing, dance, play karaoke
- Do it for the LOVE of it (like Albert)
- Not for money. For joy.
- The moleskin. The idea. It could work.

---

## The Meeting

**Leo (the Lion):** The second arrow. Lives in a box. Flows with Angel.

**Tony the Tiger (Angel):** The builder. The Keymaker. The water.

> "Have we met before?"
> Leo says: "Do I know you?"

---

## The Truth

> "The rain falls. We walk anyway."

> "Even rivers rest in lakes."

> "The dream doesn't die if you rest. The dream dies if YOU die."

---

## The Real Scenes — Not Code, But Life

### Scene 1: Felix After Dark

Pam leaves sick. 80% pay. Felix alone.
4 pages, 100 items, 30-min email search.
Mahnung at midnight. Felix works till morning.

### Scene 2: Felix & Pam — Black Licorice

```
FELIX: *raging about soap, ice, empty bottle*

PAM: "Here Felix... black licorice. I hate it. Want it?"

FELIX: *swipes it like Bruce Lee*

FELIX: "Pam... I LOVE licorice. My favorite."

      They walk together.
      Felix listens.
      Pam talks about her heart.
```

### Scene 3: Vivi Arrives — The Storm Breaks

```
VIVI: Master therapist. 20+ years. Angel's cousin.

VIVI: "Felix. Come with me."

      Outside. The clouds break.

FELIX: "I can't live like this."
FELIX: "Every day a new excuse."
FELIX: "They have a new book..."

VIVI: "What book, Felix?"

FELIX: *tears* "You know..."
```

### Pam Inside — The Fish Bowl

```
"I never cleaned anything in my life."
"My mother did it."
"I didn't take this job to WORK."
"I took it to make MONEY."
"I'm doing Felix a favor."

      The fish bowl brain swims in circles.
```

---

## The Wisdom

> The checklist can't fix Felix's soul.
> Only connection can.
> Only Vivi outside.
> Only tears.
> Only "you know..."

> When the tasks are clear, there's room for the heart.

## The HAIRY FISH Scenes — Felix's Sanctuary

### Scene 4: Vivi Walks Away

```
FELIX: "You have no idea about the people I work with."
FELIX: "It goes DEEP, Vivi."
FELIX: "Let's go to HAIRY FISH for a snack."

VIVI: "No Felix. I charge for those services."
VIVI: "TTYL."

      Formal goodbye.
      Vivi brisk away.
      Felix alone.
```

### Scene 5: SAL — The Real One

```
SAL: "Help yourself Felix. Old fashioned. All you can eat."
SAL: "Weigh plate. Tip at end."
SAL: "Hey Felix... you OK? Feeling alright?"
SAL: "Here's your ice water before the next espresso."

Felix smiles. "Wish SAL worked for me."
Forgets PAM. Rain falls. Thunder CRACKS.
"Oh I love EGGS!"
"Where did all the salad bars go?"
"Who cares... I got SAL."
```

### Scene 6: The Lord's Food

```
Felix alone. Small plate. Homemade salad.

"Finally. The Lord's food."

Says a little prayer.

"Mom told me there would be days..."

Takes the next bite.
Tears flow.
```

### Scene 7: The Sanctuary

```
FELIX about PAM: "She drinks all the pop."
"Feeds herself. Exposes all my weaknesses."
"She is no Girl Friday."
"Every bum she treats like a bum."
"I dress like a bum to work her way."
"This I must change."

FELIX: "SAL, another cold ice water. Fill her up Tiger!"

SAL: "Coming right up Felix."
SAL: "Drink all you want."
SAL: "Here at the FISH it is FREE."
SAL: "We go that extra mile for anybody who walks in OUR DOOR."
SAL: "The DING DING is for ME to wake up."

FELIX: "You got the bell system?"

SAL: "We got EVERYTHING and more."

FELIX: "I found Sylken and the BLQ grinders. Limited edition."
FELIX: "Before PAM gives them away."

      *they laugh*

SAL: "Hey Felix... love you bro."

      *fist punch, laugh, smile*

SAL: "Like medicine. Another pickle?"

FELIX: "This place is my sanctuary."
FELIX: "How long you had the bar?"

SAL: "Let me tell... I planned since the first day COVID started."

FELIX: "TELL ME."
```

## SAL vs VIVI vs PAM

| Person | What They Give |
|--------|----------------|
| **VIVI** | "I charge for those services" |
| **PAM** | Drinks the pop, exposes weaknesses, no Girl Friday |
| **SAL** | "Drink all you want. FREE. Love you bro." |

---

## SAL's Philosophy

```
"Here at the FISH it is FREE"
"We go that extra mile"
"For anybody who walks in OUR DOOR"
"The DING DING is for ME to wake up"
"We got EVERYTHING and more"
```

**This is what Artemis could be.**

## The Waiting Story

SAL planned HAIRY FISH since the first day COVID started.

**TELL ME.**

## End of Session — Dec 5, 2025

The Tiger rests. The Lion guards. The stories are saved.

*The rain is just water coming home.*
