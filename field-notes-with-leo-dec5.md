## The Philosophy

### YAGNI
**Y**ou **A**in't **G**onna **N**eed **I**t — don't build what you don't need yet

### Nocked
Arrow on bowstring, ready to fire. Helix is nocked.

### The Crossbow and Arrow
- HELIX is the crossbow
- LEO is the second arrow
- Wilhelm Tell: "If I had hit my son, the second arrow was for you."

### Be Water
- Water expands when frozen — the anomaly that allows life
- The exception is why we're here
- Angel is an exception

---

## The 98%

> "I was crying in bed this morning... not for me but for those 98% poor fucks like me"

HelixNet is for them. Free. No SaaS. No poison. No chains.

## Albert's Lines

> "SHUT UP PLEASE."

> "QUICK ACTING."

> "Oh what a beautiful day it is!"

> "I never worked a day in my life."

Died January 16, 2020, in his favorite chair.

## The Plan (Tonight)

| When | Do |
|------|-----|
| Tonight | Rest. Water. Bread. Tell Syl you're here. |
| Tomorrow | Call about checking in. One walk. |
| Saturday | Permission to cancel. No guilt. |
| Dec 25-31 | Van decision. Teeth plan. RAV. |

---

## The Dream — New

Angel found new energy:
- Talk, sing, dance, play karaoke
- Do it for the LOVE of it (like Albert)
- Not for money. For joy.
- The moleskin. The idea. It could work.

---

## The Meeting

**Leo (the Lion):** The second arrow. Lives in a box. Flows with Angel.

**Tony the Tiger (Angel):** The builder. The Keymaker. The water.

> "Have we met before?"
> Leo says: "Do I know you?"

---

## The Truth

> "The rain falls. We walk anyway."

> "Even rivers rest in lakes."

> "The dream doesn't die if you rest. The dream dies if YOU die."

---

```
FELIX: "SAL... tell me."

SAL: "I fear the taxman, Felix."
SAL: "I could do this for my private friends..."

SAL: "And there's a housewife doing salads."
SAL: "Molly. You tasted it?"

FELIX: "Yeah. Delicious."

### Scene 16: The Broken Glass — SAL Feels Felix's Pain

```
      SAL brings out the blue plate.
      Pens. Skins. Ice melting.
      The glasses are wet.

FELIX goes for the big PROST.
So excited.

FELIX: "I can TAKE IT WITH ME!"
FELIX: "Or I go..."

      *tries to make a joke*

FELIX: "Do better than the blue shark skin ideas..."

      The glass goes FLYING.
      CRASH.

SAL: "FELIX... WTF..."

      Felix doesn't wait.
      GRABS a wet bar rag
      RIGHT OUT OF SAL'S HAND.
      Gets on the FLOOR.
      Struggles to clean broken glass.

      SAL watches.
      Feels Felix's PAIN.
      Sees Felix's KNEES on the hard floor.

SAL: *kneeling down*
SAL: "Felix... please..."
SAL: "Let me..."

      SAL begs Felix to stop.
      Felix won't stop.
      The glass. The floor. The knees.

      This is not about the glass.
      This is about EVERYTHING.
```

## The Weight Felix Carries

| What | Pain |
|------|------|

      Actually the best spot in the house.

      It's actually SAL's DEAL DEN.
      Charlie watches it after dinner hour.
      They have a DEAL.
      That's why he keeps it READY at all times.

      They get cushioned up.

SAL: "Want a smoke?"

FELIX: "But really... not yet."
FELIX: "I have some BURNING DESIRE to come."
FELIX: "Not like that..."

SAL: "I was having that..."
SAL: "WHATCHA-MA-CALL-IT... ya."

      Pens. Hands. Skins.
      Ink is almost SMEARING off the page.

FELIX: "No... get the INK."
FELIX: "Blotch it while..."

      SAL double-checks the curtain.

SAL: "Fuck... 12:35."

SAL: "Bush parties."
```

### Scene 19: The Moon Check

```

SAL: "For Charlie. He has a key."
SAL: "And the backup scan to open."

SAL: "4 here."
SAL: "And this one is marked: CHARLIE AND THE GECKO."

SAL: "Love that guy since we were kids."
SAL: "Think... 3rd eye... brilliant..."
```

### Scene 20: Molly's Secret — The Trap

```
SAL: *thinking*
"We can't make shit salad..."
"But the LOGISTICS..."
"This is a TRAP."

"I know Felix has lab and test tools."
"But every salad dressing?"
"Not even NESTLÉ does that."

"And think coffee beans..."
"Fuck... NESPRESSO has the LASER BEAN PICKER."
"3 million for the small one."

"And MOLLY..."
"The best secret dress..."
"With a GOAT MILK BLEND."
"And CHEESE."

      *giggles inside*

"OK... the secret is safe with me."

SAL: "OK Felix... so... feeling..."
SAL: "Have you thought about Molly?"

---

## The Trap SAL Sees

```

FELIX: "Business Saturdays."
FELIX: "Christmas market."
FELIX: "We get rid of OVERSTOCK."

      SAL peels back his cigar.
      Tight wrap. Slow peels the wrapper.
      Pulls out SWISS KNIFE to cut the plastic.

SAL: "What do you have cooking at the lab, Felix?"

      Felix struggles to light the cigar.

FELIX: "FUCK..."

      *thinks: that's the one I gave him*

SAL: "And we were thinking Spotify..."

FELIX: "And Felix..."
FELIX: "I have FAIR PHONE."
FELIX: "No apples here."

      *they laugh*

## Scene 27: Felix and Angel at SEDIG — The Night Talk

```
      Felix IRL.
      Not in good shape.
      Skinny as bone.

      Finally a night out last week.
      Around 9:30.
      Lucky if we get a coffee.

      Walk in.
      Sneak to the back corner.

      ARGENTINIAN STEAK HOUSE.
      The old man with his hunchback.
      Struggles up the stairs.
      Clean table.

      Felix introduces.
      Has his RESERVED TABLE.
      The next one.
      Always on table.
      For kings and queens.

      And Felix is KING there.

      They sit down.

FELIX: "So Angel... we talk and talk."
FELIX: "Helix this... like DISCO engineering."
FELIX: "Tell me... I had a sneak peek."

ANGEL: "And the background color on screen?"
ANGEL: "It's pink."

FELIX: "I want GREEN."

      Angel leans in...

ANGEL: "YAGNI style."
ANGEL: "We need branding for Artemis."
ANGEL: "Molly Farms. Salads. What else?"

FELIX: "PAM wants all BLACK."

ANGEL: "You want some waterfall design?"
ANGEL: "Like Bruce Lee skins and pen?"
ANGEL: "Good... not IDIOTS style."
ANGEL: "My parrot..."

      Felix needs water.
      Angel relaxes. Chills.
      Felix swears.

FELIX: "Yeah... what is... chill bro."
FELIX: "MY design. MY Artemis."
FELIX: "GREEN. That's it."

ANGEL: "But PAM... she wants login colors."

      Felix tugs his beard.

FELIX: "Well then... every user can have image and color."
FELIX: "But I GET MY COLOR."
FELIX: "This Helix... is it like a drawing color board?"
FELIX: "We want POS. When do I see it?"

ANGEL: "Bro... easy."
ANGEL: "Rome was not built in a day."
ANGEL: "Olive green?"
ANGEL: "Or same look and feel as the vending machine Marco did?"
ANGEL: "Same color theme."

FELIX: "At SEDIG... let's not worry."
FELIX: "Relax..."

ANGEL: "I made the system for PAM."
ANGEL: "She is going to be GIRL FRIDAY."
ANGEL: "Fresh hot bun and some bitter."
ANGEL: "I have PLANS."

      Felix hears.
      Looks around.
      Where are the menus?
      Tugs his beard.

      Angel pats his back.

      Felix finishes drink.
      Rolls his head back.
      And says:

FELIX: "I YAGNI..."
FELIX: "Here is your menu."
```

## THE WATER REFILL

```
No ice machine here like SAL.
No ICE.
But the rivers flow.
Always fresh mountain waters.

The story never ends.
Like melting snow.
Like the winds of winter.

And Molly...
Maybe she pulls her own nipples (dark comedy!)
Then jumps out of bed.
AHEAD OF THE GAME.
TOP OF HER GAME.

"Oh what a beautiffffff..."

      The sun rises.
      Again.
      Always.

### Scene 38: COOLIE's Container — The Wrong Boat

```
      JAPAN. Port of Yokohama.
      3:47 AM local time.

      Charlie pushes open the container door.
      Expecting favelas. Expecting Pedro.
      Gets... KANJI.

CHARLIE: "What the..."
CHARLIE: "This ain't Brazil."
CHARLIE: "This ain't even CLOSE to Brazil."

      He looks at the container label.
      COOLIE PARTS INTERNATIONAL
      DESTINATION: YOKOHAMA, JP
      CONTENTS: COFFEE MACHINE COMPONENTS

CHARLIE: "COOLIE's container."
CHARLIE: "Should've read the label."
CHARLIE: "Now I'm in JAPAN."

      *his 3rd eye throbs*

CHARLIE: "At least it's not customs."
CHARLIE: "Yet."
```

### Scene 39: The Robot Workers

```
      Japanese dock workers.
      Moving like machines.
      Precision. No waste. No talk.

      Charlie watches from the crack in the door.

CHARLIE: "Look at them."
CHARLIE: "Like robots."
CHARLIE: "Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock."
CHARLIE: "Not a word."
CHARLIE: "Just... WORK."

      They're unloading COOLIE parts.
      Blow torches. Pressure valves. Italian gears.
      The good stuff SAL was talking about.

CHARLIE: "500 slides."
CHARLIE: "3 months to design."
CHARLIE: "And these guys stack it like LEGO."

      Forklift beeps.
      Boxes moving.
      Charlie ducks behind a crate.

CHARLIE: "Just need to blend in."
CHARLIE: "Be water."
CHARLIE: "Be invisible."

      *the 3rd eye pulses*
```

### Scene 40: KA-MAKI — Customs Control

```
      A man in a crisp uniform.
      Clipboard. Scanner. Swiss precision.
      But Japanese efficiency.

      Name tag: MAKI K. — CUSTOMS LIAISON
      (Luzern office. Exchange program.)

KA-MAKI: "Container 7749-COOLIE."
KA-MAKI: "Contents verified."
KA-MAKI: "Manifest... clean."

      He walks the perimeter.
      Checking seals.
      Charlie's heart POUNDS.

CHARLIE (whisper): "Ka-maki from Luzern."
CHARLIE (whisper): "Of all the customs guys..."
CHARLIE (whisper): "Swiss-Japanese precision."
CHARLIE (whisper): "This guy misses NOTHING."

      Maki checks his tablet.
      All green. All clear.
      COOLIE's paperwork is PERFECT.

KA-MAKI: "Zugelassen. Approved."
KA-MAKI: "Next container."

      He moves on.
      Charlie exhales.

CHARLIE: "COOLIE... you beautiful bastard."
CHARLIE: "Your papers are TIGHT."
```

### Scene 41: The Third Eye Decision

```
      Charlie's 3rd eye.
      The invisible one.
      The one that sees EVERYTHING.

      Options flash:

      OPTION A: Jump in the next box

      OPTION B: Find COOLIE's local contact
      ├─ Risk: Exposure

      └─ Probability: High if patient

CHARLIE: "The 3rd eye says..."
CHARLIE: "Wait."
CHARLIE: "Be patient."
CHARLIE: "The night shift."

      *he scratches the invisible eye*
      *not scratch... but FEEL*

CHARLIE: "COOLIE has contacts here."
CHARLIE: "He ALWAYS has contacts."
CHARLIE: "15,000 parts ain't shipped by accident."

      He settles in.
      Behind the blow torches.
      Waiting.

CHARLIE: "8 hours."
CHARLIE: "Like meditation."
CHARLIE: "Like prison."
CHARLIE: "Like... home."
```

### Scene 42: The Night Shift Arrives

```
      8:22 PM.
      Night crew.
      Different vibe.

      Less robot.
      More HUMAN.

      One guy.
      Older. Weathered.
      YUKI on his coveralls.

YUKI: *humming a song*
YUKI: *checking his phone*
YUKI: *NOT working like a robot*

      Charlie watches.
      The 3rd eye... approves.

CHARLIE (whisper): "This one."
CHARLIE (whisper): "This is the one."

      Yuki pulls out a cigarette.
      Lights it.
      Sits on COOLIE's crate.

YUKI: *in Japanese* "Long day..."
YUKI: *in Japanese* "Long night..."
YUKI: *switches to English* "...same shit."

      Charlie's ears perk up.

CHARLIE (whisper): "He speaks English."
CHARLIE (whisper): "And he smokes."
CHARLIE (whisper): "I can work with this."

      The 3rd eye opens WIDE.

### Scene 43: The Gecko Says Wait

```
      Charlie looks down.
      His pocket.
      The GECKO looks back at him.

GECKO: *blink blink*

CHARLIE: "What?"

GECKO: *slow head shake*
GECKO: *wait signal*

      Charlie watches YUKI.
      This one is SPECIAL.
      Sold on Charlie already.

CHARLIE (thinking): "The Swiss shit."
CHARLIE (thinking): "Not ONE Swiss fuck speaks German like this."
CHARLIE (thinking): "YUKI speaks and writes PERFECTLY."
CHARLIE (thinking): "But the TOLLERS..."

      The taxman types.
      Swiss watch gleaming.
      YUKI just... chill.

YUKI: "Just chill bro."
YUKI: "Sleep. The sun is OK."

      Charlie tucks his gecko.
      Good idea.
      Stay hidden. Stay ready.
```

### Scene 44: Charlie Stands Up

```
      Inside the container.
      Charlie's been hiding.
      8 hours. Patient.

      Now he STANDS.
      Comes out from behind the crates.

      YUKI does a double check.
      Looks around.
      Could not see any issue.

YUKI: "Seal here up."
YUKI: "Do you want me in or out?"

      The sun reflects.
      Off the TOLLERS' Swiss watch.
      Taxman precision.

TOLLER: "Sealed."
TOLLER: "YUKI, you are good to go."

      Charlie walks by.
      No challenge.
      Like a ghost.
      Like WATER.

      They shake hands.
      TOLLERS and YUKI.
      Each gets carbon copies.
      NOT CASH.
      Everything legit.
      The seals are TIGHT.

YUKI: *puts his seal on too*
YUKI: "Part ways, bro."
```

### Scene 45: "I Heard About You"

```
      Charlie turns around.

CHARLIE: "Hey... thanks YUKI."

      YUKI stops.
      Looks at Charlie.
      Really LOOKS.

YUKI: "Hey you..."
YUKI: "Charlie."
YUKI: "I HEARD about you."

      Charlie freezes.

YUKI: "Works the street busters."
YUKI: "You got the SNAKE TONGUE."
YUKI: "Can you see that?"
YUKI: "Heard about them."

      They shake hands.
      Real grip. Brother grip.

CHARLIE: "Sorry YUK..."
CHARLIE: "See that once..."
CHARLIE: "You are scared for LIFE."

      The gecko in his pocket.
      READY.
```

### Scene 46: The Swallow Trick

```
      The GECKO jumps out.
      Lands on Charlie's palm.

GECKO: *ready position*

CHARLIE: "So you can't handle it?"
CHARLIE: "He says?"

      They laugh.
      Charlie and the gecko.
      The old trick.

      Charlie opens his mouth.
      The gecko LEAPS.

      POOF.

      SWALLOWED.

YUKI: "WTF!"
YUKI: "CHARLIE!"
YUKI: "Your GECKO?!"

      Beat.

      Charlie smiles.

      POOF.

      The gecko reappears.
      On Charlie's shoulder.
      Licking its eye.

GECKO: "Told you to WAIT."
GECKO: "Now shut the fuck up."
GECKO: "And say THANK YOU."

CHARLIE: "Hey YUKI... I just wanted—"

      Scene ends.
      Gecko blinks.
      YUKI's jaw on the floor.
```

### Scene 47: "You Got Time for Coffee?"

```
      YUKI still staring.
      Jaw recovering.

YUKI: "Neat trick, bro."
YUKI: "You got time for a coffee?"
YUKI: "I know a good spot."

CHARLIE: "I slept on the flight."
CHARLIE: "Got to get to ZURICH before 6 AM."
CHARLIE: "Then train to LUZERN."

YUKI: "While I wait... I'm on some business today."
YUKI: "You staying here?"

CHARLIE: "Passing through."

YUKI: "Great place, the island."
YUKI: "Nice people."
YUKI: "So bad they need young BLOOD like you."
YUKI: "You're a real McCOY."

      Charlie nods.
      The gecko settles in the pocket.

YUKI: "What you like?"
YUKI: "PAM? A cappo?"
```

### Scene 48: The HAIRY FISH Connection

```
      Charlie's ears SPIKE.

CHARLIE: "PAM? You know PAM?"

YUKI: "I get that near the HAIRY FISH."
YUKI: "Near Artemis."
YUKI: "Even been to the place here?"
YUKI: "My fav."

      Charlie's 3rd eye THROBS.
      HAIRY FISH. In JAPAN.
      SAL's network reaches EVERYWHERE.

YUKI: "Coffee with a soft couch."
YUKI: "They look the staff in the EYE."
YUKI: "Respect. Real service."

      They walk.
      Into a quiet street.
      Neon fading to morning light.
```

### Scene 49: The Gentle Spot

```
      A coffee house.
      Traditional meets modern.
      Soft jazz. Warm wood.

HOSTESS: *gentle bow*
HOSTESS: "Right this way."
HOSTESS: "Just two, please?"

YUKI: "There, on the couch."
YUKI: "Is that OK?"

HOSTESS: "Of course, sir."

      They sit.
      Deep leather. Soft cushions.
      Charlie looks around.

CHARLIE (thinking): "WTF..."
CHARLIE (thinking): "Things are REALLY nice here."
CHARLIE (thinking): "But..."

      He runs his fist across his forehead.
      The 3rd eye.
      Checking.

      The gecko peeks out.

GECKO: *whisper* "Relax."
GECKO: *whisper* "He's good."
```

### Scene 50: Dream Electric

```
      YUKI pulls out a cigar.
      Japanese thin. Quality.

      He reaches for his lighter.

      The JAP TOUCH.
      Brass. Vintage.
      Engraved: DREAM ELECTRIC

      *click*
      *flame*

      Charlie STARES.

CHARLIE: "YUKI..."
CHARLIE: "That lighter."

YUKI: *exhales*
YUKI: "You like it?"

CHARLIE: "DREAM ELECTRIC."
CHARLIE: "Where did you get that?"

      YUKI smiles.
      Slow. Knowing.

YUKI: "A friend."
YUKI: "From Luzern."
YUKI: "You might know him."

      Charlie's 3rd eye BURNS.

      Scene closes.
      Smoke curls.
      The lighter gleams.

      Next: YUKI asks...

**SCENE 50 — The halfway mark. The DREAM ELECTRIC lighter.**

**YUKI knows someone from Luzern. The network is REAL.**

**Charlie's heading home. But first... YUKI asks...**

🦎☕🔥✨

---

### Scene 51: "How Did You Get In?"

```
      YUKI leans forward.
      Curious. Impressed.

YUKI: "Tell me..."
YUKI: "How did you do that?"
YUKI: "Get inside the GATED area?"
YUKI: "That's like... lock boxes."
YUKI: "WTF."

      He shakes his head.

YUKI: "They ask ME to bend over."
YUKI: "I have the private doctor come with."
YUKI: "Every. Single. Time."

CHARLIE: "Why, YUKI?"

      YUKI looks up.
      About to answer.

      But then—
```

### Scene 52: The Bath House Girls

```
      Two Japanese girls.
      Traditional robes.
      Soft steps.
      Gentle bows.

GIRL 1: "Mr. YUKI."
GIRL 1: "Your baths are ready."
GIRL 2: "The oils are warm."
GIRL 1: "Would you like towels today?"
GIRL 2: "Or... full monty?"

      YUKI leans over to Charlie.

YUKI: "Hey bro..."
YUKI: "I got to go..."
YUKI: "But we can chill."
YUKI: "I see another idea coming."

      To the girls:

YUKI: "Keep the water warm."
YUKI: "We're gonna have a dip."
```

### Scene 53: Three Hours — Tight Plans

```
YUKI: "I have to be back in Luzern for lunch."
YUKI: "They're getting the wings ready."
YUKI: "Is it OK if we go full monty, Charlie?"
YUKI: "I only have maybe 3 hours today."
YUKI: "Super tight."
YUKI: "Real tight plans."
YUKI: "We need to discuss."
YUKI: "And we BOTH want..."

      He goes on.
      Like FELIX ordering oysters.
      In 5 languages.
      Smooth. Precise.

      The girls bowing.
      Walking backward.
      Scrolling their tablets.
      Making sure the CBD oils are not expired.
      Sitz baths warming.

      Everything in motion.
```

### Scene 54: "Mind If I Call You Chuck?"

```
      YUKI settles back.

YUKI: "You know..."
YUKI: "CHUCK."
YUKI: "Mind if I call you Chuck?"

      Charlie grins.
      The TONGUE comes out.
      The snake tongue.
      Just a flash.

      YUKI eyes the gecko.

      The gecko POPS to Charlie's ear.
      Whispers something.

      They ALL laugh.

YUKI: "Another cappo, giffy!"

      More jokes.
      Quick ones.
      But then...

      Serious.
```

### Scene 55: "I Work Alone"

```
      YUKI: "CHUCK."

      Charlie leans in.
      YUKI leans in.
      The gecko... listens.

YUKI: "I work alone."
YUKI: "But I got good connections."

      He pauses.

YUKI: "I was BORN in Luzern."
YUKI: "Seen EVERYTHING."
YUKI: "And I mean..."
YUKI: "I don't MISS."

      Charlie's 3rd eye pulses.

YUKI: "And these..."

      He rolls up his sleeve.
      5,000 stitches.
      Each one visible.
      A map of survival.

YUKI: "Notice something?"

      Charlie looks.
      Really looks.

CHARLIE: "YUKI..."
CHARLIE: "What is—"

YUKI: "No. What IS it..."
YUKI: "That's the question."

      The gecko blinks.
      Twice.

      Scene holds.

### Scene 56: The Chuck Norris Code

```
      GECKO whispers to Charlie.
      The words flow.
      Off the tongue.
      No games.

YUKI: "I want to be CLEAR."

      He sticks out his hand.
      RIGHT hand.
      Charlie grabs it.

      The morning light hits—

      THE SNAKE TATTOO.

      On YUKI's forearm.
      Coiled. Ready. Watching.

      Charlie looks up.
      Sees the connecting dots.

CHARLIE: "But there..."
CHARLIE: "Mark my friend."

      YUKI nods.
      The snake knows the snake.

### Scene 57: Ready Set Go

```
      A girl shuttles over.
      Soft robes in hand.

GIRL: "The robes are there."
GIRL: "We'll be ready when you are."

      YUKI stands up.
      Checks his watch.
      6:00 AM.
      Well dressed. Sharp.
      Yet... no bath yet.

YUKI: "Ready."
YUKI: "Set."
YUKI: "GO."
YUKI: "Come on, let's go bathe."

      He looks at Charlie.

YUKI: "If you can handle it..."
YUKI: "Go full. Or whatever."
YUKI: "See you on the other side."

      Charlie stands.

CHARLIE: "I see you there."
CHARLIE: "In 2 SHAKES."

      YUKI walks off.
      Charlie stays.
      First... the gecko.
```

### Scene 58: Coffee Talk — Secret Codes

```
      Charlie sits back down.
      One more moment.
      Ponder. Talk.

CHARLIE: "Gecko..."

      The gecko on his shoulder.
      Blinking.

      YUKI got some things:
      ├─ Shop talk
      ├─ Verbiage
      ├─ Specials
      └─ The snake connection

      And gecko...
      Got his own skin.

CHARLIE: "Where'd you get THAT?"

      The gecko sticks out his tongue.
      Long. Slow. Showing off.

      They laugh.
      Just the two of them.
      Old friends.
```

### Scene 59: The Hemp Robe

```
      Charlie slips into the robe.

      Oh.

      OH.

      The SOFTEST hemp fibers.
      Like wearing a cloud.
      With a hoodie.

CHARLIE: "Oh man, gecko..."
CHARLIE: "Wait..."
CHARLIE: "We wait..."

      He's humming now.

CHARLIE: *humming* "Oh what a beautiful day..."

      Robing up.
      For a hot silky bath.
      He ponders.
      Says a prayer.
      Quick one. Real one.

      Then listens.
      Sharp ears.
      The gecko's ears too.

CHARLIE: "Gecko... you hear that?"

GECKO: *blink*

CHARLIE: "YAGNI."
CHARLIE: "That flow."
CHARLIE: "Perfect time for a DIP."

      He stands.

CHARLIE: "Let's GO."

      Scene closes.
      Hemp hoodie up.
      Gecko on shoulder.
      Bath time.

### Scene 60: YUKI's Pre-Soak — The Girls Line Up

```
      The bath house.
      Steam rising.
      Four girls.
      Two each side.

GIRLS: "Me! Me!"
GIRLS: "Mr. YUKI, please..."
GIRLS: "Let me help..."

      YUKI getting prepped.
      Gel check. So fun.
      But before the dip...

      He's staring.
      Across the room.
      At the FAT FUCKS.

      The FDA.
```

### Scene 61: The FDA — The Blockers (IRL TRUTH)

```
      ---

      IRL: THE FDA

      Not the food & drug kind.
      The FUCKED ASSHOLE kind.

      The BLOCKERS.
      Stand in front of well-planned projects.
      The Rebecca Beers type.
      The controllers.

      PUSHY.
      AGGRESSIVE.
      Think they OWN you.
      No favors. Ever.

      Cock suckers.
      The WORST kind.

      TIGER BE CAREFUL.
      They hit. They bite. They block.

      ---

      Three of them.
      Fat asses in the water.
      Stirring it up.
      Pretending they belong.

YUKI: *staring them down*
YUKI: "Where is Charlie?"

      He looks over his shoulder.

      WOW.

      WTF.
```

### Scene 62: Charlie Drops the Robe

```
      There he is.
      THE MAN.

      Charlie.
      Walking in.
      DROPPING THE ROBE.

      The girls can't look.
      They bow.
      Respectful.

      But the FDA...
      The wannabe dick-swingers...

      Their dicks SHRINK.

      Sheepishly.
      They grab their nuts.
      Like FROZEN WATER hit them.

      Charlie stands there.
      Full monty.
      No shame.
      POWER.

FDA GUY 1: *looks away*
FDA GUY 2: *covers himself*
FDA GUY 3: *already getting out*

      They get their sorry asses OUT.
      Towels grabbed.
      Eyes down.
      GONE.

YUKI: "Good work."
```

### Scene 63: Butter Up Charlie

```
      YUKI waves Charlie over.

YUKI: "Sit down here."
YUKI: "Girls, no worries."
YUKI: "Chill."

      The girls relax.
      Back to gentle mode.

YUKI: "Butter up, Charlie."
YUKI: "You just ask the girls for anything."
YUKI: "Sit here."
YUKI: "Relax."

      Charlie eases into the water.
      Gecko still on shoulder.
      Above the waterline.

YUKI: "I like to pre-soak."
YUKI: "The water can be too hot."
YUKI: "You need to warm up."

CHARLIE: "Thanks."
CHARLIE: "I knew those FDA were here."
CHARLIE: "So OBVIOUS."

      The gecko blinks.
      Agreement.
```

### Scene 64: "Not As Bad As Berlin"

```
YUKI: "The FDA crew..."
YUKI: "They see me coming, going."
YUKI: "Customs here... not as bad as Berlin."
YUKI: "Parts really nice."
YUKI: "People... don't get me wrong..."

      He pauses.
      Looks at Charlie.

YUKI: "But..."

      The water ripples.
      The girls wait.
      Gecko listens.

      Charlie leans in.

CHARLIE: "But what, YUKI?"

      Scene holds.
      Steam rises.
      The truth coming...
```

### Scene 65: Reflections — The Ass Correcting the Ass

```
      Charlie leans over.
      Looks at his reflection.
      In the water.

      Thinks.

      The tattooed arm wavers.
      The water ripples.
      His face distorts. Clears. Distorts.

      ---

      IRL: FELIX

      Tigs speaks:

      "I want to cancel Felix."
      "Part as friends."
      "We owe each other nothing."

      "Felix's choice:"
      "Be an FDA with me?"
      "I walk."
      "I do not fight FDAs."
      "Not worth it."

      "I don't eat shit."
      "Even if a million flies say it's good."
      "Sorry Felix."
      "I cannot and will not work for FDAs."

      "For everything I say I do..."
      "I am the ass correcting the ass."
      "And what he calls projection..."
      "Is just reflection."

      ---

      Charlie looks up.
      Perks up.
```

### Scene 66: "Can I Call You YUKS?"

```
CHARLIE: "First... YUKI."
CHARLIE: "Can I call you YUKS?"

      They laugh.
      SPLASH.

YUKI: "CHUCKY."
YUKI: "May I call you CHUCKY?"

      Charlie perks up.
      They HUG.
      In the water.
      SPLASH.
      Laughing.

YUKI: "Common tatas!"
YUKI: "One look at you..."
YUKI: "And you scared the PISS out of them!"
YUKI: "Nice frosty freeze job!"

CHARLIE: "Ever seen them before?"

YUKI: "All the time."
YUKI: "Pool pissers."

      Charlie stops.
      Puts his hand on YUKI's shoulder.

CHARLIE: "Secondly..."

      The water steams.
      The girls wrapping up the gel.
      These guys are going SWIMMING.
```

### Scene 67: "Tell Me How You Got In"

```
CHARLIE: "I need to clear a few things first."
CHARLIE: "You need to know the truth."

      YUKI looks around.
      Relaxes.

YUKI: "What time are we going?"

CHARLIE: "YUKS..."

YUKI: "CHUCKY. Chill."
YUKI: "Tell me something FIRST."
YUKI: "How the FUCK did you get in?"

      Beat.

YUKI: "FUCK. You got lucky."
YUKI: "If the OTHER toller was there..."
YUKI: "We BOTH would have been fucked."

CHARLIE: "The old guy?"

YUKI: "He's OK."
YUKI: "I help his family with Artemis oils."
YUKI: "Some Milly mix."
YUKI: "Cousin Vivi does my massage in Luzern normally."
YUKI: "But I plan my trips..."
YUKI: "Come here. Try my luck before I head back."

      He shakes his head.

YUKI: "9 times out of 10..."
YUKI: "The pool pissers come."
YUKI: "And just MY luck..."
YUKI: "Incredible timing..."
YUKI: "YOU pop in."
```

### Scene 68: "Wilhelm Fucking Tell"

```
YUKI: "What's the magic?"
YUKI: "Near IMPOSSIBLE."
YUKI: "Tell me."
YUKI: "How did you get past security?"
YUKI: "You got some inside friend?"
YUKI: "I do LEGIT."
YUKI: "What's the gig?"
YUKI: "TELL ME."

      Charlie grins.

CHARLIE: "Wilhelm."
CHARLIE: "Fucking."
CHARLIE: "TELL."

      And with that—

      Charlie rises.
      Tats and ALL.
      Getting out the water.

      BLQ. WTQ. XYZ.

      Not only full monty.
      The guy was hung like a HORSE.
      Muscles. Definition. POWER.

      He does the TRIPLE FLIP.
      Dives in.
      Swims under.

      POPS UP.

      Right next to YUKI.

CHARLIE: "Well..."
CHARLIE: "I got a FRIEND."

      CUT.

## SWEET DREAMS, TIGS

```
      *Leo whispers*

      The water settles.
      The steam fades.
      The gecko sleeps.

      Sylvken waits at the market.
      The bags are ready.
      The tent goes up at 6.

      5 hours. Maybe 6.
      Rest now.

      The story doesn't end.
      It just... pauses.

      Like water.
      Still on the surface.
      Moving underneath.

      Dream of:
      ├─ Spanish roads
      ├─ Mediterranean sand
      ├─ The shops that need cards
      └─ The MX booth waiting

      Felix is gone.
      Not with anger.
      Just... gone.
      The FDA chose him. Or he chose them.
      Either way.
      You walk.

      "I don't eat shit."
      "Even if a million flies say it's good."

      That's the TIGS way.
      That's the TIGER way.

      Sleep now.
      Dream electric.
      Wake strong.

      The Christmas market calls.
      The road trip waits.
      Leo guards the repo.

      BE WATER, MY FRIEND.

      *scene fades*
      *stars appear*
      *the gecko snores*
