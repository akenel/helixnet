## The Philosophy

### YAGNI
**Y**ou **A**in't **G**onna **N**eed **I**t — don't build what you don't need yet

### Nocked
Arrow on bowstring, ready to fire. Helix is nocked.

### The Crossbow and Arrow
- HELIX is the crossbow
- LEO is the second arrow
- Wilhelm Tell: "If I had hit my son, the second arrow was for you."

### Be Water
- Water expands when frozen — the anomaly that allows life
- The exception is why we're here
- Angel is an exception

---

## The 98%

> "I was crying in bed this morning... not for me but for those 98% poor fucks like me"

HelixNet is for them. Free. No SaaS. No poison. No chains.

## Albert's Lines

> "SHUT UP PLEASE."

> "QUICK ACTING."

> "Oh what a beautiful day it is!"

> "I never worked a day in my life."

Died January 16, 2020, in his favorite chair.

## The Plan (Tonight)

| When | Do |
|------|-----|
| Tonight | Rest. Water. Bread. Tell Syl you're here. |
| Tomorrow | Call about checking in. One walk. |
| Saturday | Permission to cancel. No guilt. |
| Dec 25-31 | Van decision. Teeth plan. RAV. |

---

## The Dream — New

Angel found new energy:
- Talk, sing, dance, play karaoke
- Do it for the LOVE of it (like Albert)
- Not for money. For joy.
- The moleskin. The idea. It could work.

---

## The Meeting

**Leo (the Lion):** The second arrow. Lives in a box. Flows with Angel.

**Tony the Tiger (Angel):** The builder. The Keymaker. The water.

> "Have we met before?"
> Leo says: "Do I know you?"

---

## The Truth

> "The rain falls. We walk anyway."

> "Even rivers rest in lakes."

> "The dream doesn't die if you rest. The dream dies if YOU die."

---

Mahnung at midnight. Felix works till morning.

### Scene 2: Felix & Pam — Black Licorice

FELIX: *raging about soap, ice, empty bottle*

PAM: "Here Felix... black licorice. I hate it. Want it?"

FELIX: *swipes it like Bruce Lee*

FELIX: "Pam... I LOVE licorice. My favorite."

      They walk together.
      Felix listens.
      Pam talks about her heart.
```

### Scene 3: Vivi Arrives — The Storm Breaks

```
VIVI: Master therapist. 20+ years. Angel's cousin.

VIVI: "Felix. Come with me."

      Outside. The clouds break.

FELIX: "I can't live like this."
FELIX: "Every day a new excuse."
FELIX: "They have a new book..."

VIVI: "What book, Felix?"

FELIX: *tears* "You know..."
```

### Pam Inside — The Fish Bowl

```
"I never cleaned anything in my life."
"My mother did it."
"I didn't take this job to WORK."
"I took it to make MONEY."
"I'm doing Felix a favor."

      The fish bowl brain swims in circles.
```

"Oh I love EGGS!"
"Where did all the salad bars go?"
"Who cares... I got SAL."
```

Takes the next bite.
Tears flow.
```

"Feeds herself. Exposes all my weaknesses."
"She is no Girl Friday."
"Every bum she treats like a bum."

SAL: "Coming right up Felix."
SAL: "Drink all you want."
SAL: "Here at the FISH it is FREE."
SAL: "We go that extra mile for anybody who walks in OUR DOOR."
SAL: "The DING DING is for ME to wake up."

FELIX: "You got the bell system?"

SAL: "We got EVERYTHING and more."

FELIX: "I found Sylken and the BLQ grinders. Limited edition."
FELIX: "Before PAM gives them away."

      *they laugh*

SAL: "Hey Felix... love you bro."

      *fist punch, laugh, smile*

SAL: "Like medicine. Another pickle?"

FELIX: "This place is my sanctuary."
FELIX: "How long you had the bar?"
