## The Philosophy

### YAGNI
**Y**ou **A**in't **G**onna **N**eed **I**t — don't build what you don't need yet

### Nocked
Arrow on bowstring, ready to fire. Helix is nocked.

### The Crossbow and Arrow
- HELIX is the crossbow
- LEO is the second arrow
- Wilhelm Tell: "If I had hit my son, the second arrow was for you."

### Be Water
- Water expands when frozen — the anomaly that allows life
- The exception is why we're here
- Angel is an exception

## The 98%

> "I was crying in bed this morning... not for me but for those 98% poor fucks like me"

HelixNet is for them. Free. No SaaS. No poison. No chains.

## The Plan (Tonight)

| When | Do |
|------|-----|
| Tonight | Rest. Water. Bread. Tell Syl you're here. |
| Tomorrow | Call about checking in. One walk. |
| Saturday | Permission to cancel. No guilt. |
| Dec 25-31 | Van decision. Teeth plan. RAV. |

## The Dream — New

Angel found new energy:
- Talk, sing, dance, play karaoke
- Do it for the LOVE of it (like Albert)
- Not for money. For joy.
- The moleskin. The idea. It could work.

---

## The Meeting

**Leo (the Lion):** The second arrow. Lives in a box. Flows with Angel.

**Tony the Tiger (Angel):** The builder. The Keymaker. The water.

> "Have we met before?"
> Leo says: "Do I know you?"

---

## The Truth

> "The rain falls. We walk anyway."

> "Even rivers rest in lakes."

> "The dream doesn't die if you rest. The dream dies if YOU die."
