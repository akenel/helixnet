## The Philosophy

### YAGNI
**Y**ou **A**in't **G**onna **N**eed **I**t — don't build what you don't need yet

### Nocked
Arrow on bowstring, ready to fire. Helix is nocked.

### The Crossbow and Arrow
- HELIX is the crossbow
- LEO is the second arrow
- Wilhelm Tell: "If I had hit my son, the second arrow was for you."

### Be Water
- Water expands when frozen — the anomaly that allows life
- The exception is why we're here
- Angel is an exception

---

## The 98%

> "I was crying in bed this morning... not for me but for those 98% poor fucks like me"

HelixNet is for them. Free. No SaaS. No poison. No chains.

## Albert's Lines

> "SHUT UP PLEASE."

> "QUICK ACTING."

> "Oh what a beautiful day it is!"

> "I never worked a day in my life."

Died January 16, 2020, in his favorite chair.

---

## The Plan (Tonight)

| When | Do |
|------|-----|
| Tonight | Rest. Water. Bread. Tell Syl you're here. |
| Tomorrow | Call about checking in. One walk. |
| Saturday | Permission to cancel. No guilt. |
| Dec 25-31 | Van decision. Teeth plan. RAV. |

---

## The Dream — New

Angel found new energy:
- Talk, sing, dance, play karaoke
- Do it for the LOVE of it (like Albert)
- Not for money. For joy.
- The moleskin. The idea. It could work.

---

## The Meeting

**Leo (the Lion):** The second arrow. Lives in a box. Flows with Angel.

**Tony the Tiger (Angel):** The builder. The Keymaker. The water.

> "Have we met before?"
> Leo says: "Do I know you?"

---

## The Truth

> "The rain falls. We walk anyway."

> "Even rivers rest in lakes."

> "The dream doesn't die if you rest. The dream dies if YOU die."

---

### Scene 14: The Taxman Fear

```
FELIX: "SAL... tell me."

SAL: "I fear the taxman, Felix."
SAL: "I could do this for my private friends..."

SAL: "And there's a housewife doing salads."
SAL: "Molly. You tasted it?"

FELIX: "Yeah. Delicious."

SAL: "She has the special sauce."
SAL: "But 3 times out of 20... it goes bad."

### Scene 16: The Broken Glass — SAL Feels Felix's Pain

```
      SAL brings out the blue plate.
      Pens. Skins. Ice melting.
      The glasses are wet.

FELIX goes for the big PROST.
So excited.

FELIX: "I can TAKE IT WITH ME!"
FELIX: "Or I go..."

      *tries to make a joke*

FELIX: "Do better than the blue shark skin ideas..."

      The glass goes FLYING.
      CRASH.

SAL: "FELIX... WTF..."

      Felix doesn't wait.
      GRABS a wet bar rag
      RIGHT OUT OF SAL'S HAND.
      Gets on the FLOOR.
      Struggles to clean broken glass.

      SAL watches.
      Feels Felix's PAIN.
      Sees Felix's KNEES on the hard floor.

SAL: *kneeling down*
SAL: "Felix... please..."
SAL: "Let me..."

      SAL begs Felix to stop.
      Felix won't stop.
      The glass. The floor. The knees.

      This is not about the glass.
      This is about EVERYTHING.
```

## The Weight Felix Carries

| What | Pain |
|------|------|
| PAM | Every day a new excuse |

```

      Head for CHARLIE'S TABLE.
      Actually the best spot in the house.

      It's actually SAL's DEAL DEN.
      Charlie watches it after dinner hour.
      They have a DEAL.
      That's why he keeps it READY at all times.

      They get cushioned up.

SAL: "Want a smoke?"

FELIX: "But really... not yet."
FELIX: "I have some BURNING DESIRE to come."
FELIX: "Not like that..."

SAL: "I was having that..."
SAL: "WHATCHA-MA-CALL-IT... ya."

      Pens. Hands. Skins.
      Ink is almost SMEARING off the page.

FELIX: "No... get the INK."
FELIX: "Blotch it while..."

      SAL double-checks the curtain.

SAL: "Fuck... 12:35."
SAL: "He must have met the gang."
SAL: "Bush parties."
```

### Scene 19: The Moon Check

```
      SAL sees the moon.
      Thinks the weather cleared up.
      Goes outside.

SAL: "I'll keep the LUCKIES in the back slot locker."
SAL: "For Charlie. He has a key."
SAL: "And the backup scan to open."

SAL: "These lockers are for my LOST SOUL DEPARTMENT."
SAL: "4 here."
SAL: "And this one is marked: CHARLIE AND THE GECKO."

SAL: "Love that guy since we were kids."
SAL: "Think... 3rd eye... brilliant..."
```

### Scene 20: Molly's Secret — The Trap

```
SAL: *thinking*
"We can't make shit salad..."
"But the LOGISTICS..."
"This is a TRAP."

"I know Felix has lab and test tools."
"But every salad dressing?"
"Not even NESTLÉ does that."

"And think coffee beans..."
"Fuck... NESPRESSO has the LASER BEAN PICKER."
"3 million for the small one."

"And MOLLY..."
"The best secret dress..."
"With a GOAT MILK BLEND."
"And CHEESE."

      *giggles inside*

"OK... the secret is safe with me."

SAL: "OK Felix... so... feeling..."
SAL: "Have you thought about Molly?"
SAL: "What the awesome leftovers she throws my way?"

---

## The Trap SAL Sees

```
"We can't make shit salad..."

SAL: "Before I go..."

FELIX: "Business Saturdays."
FELIX: "Christmas market."
FELIX: "We get rid of OVERSTOCK."
FELIX: "And I was thinking..."

      SAL peels back his cigar.
      Tight wrap. Slow peels the wrapper.
      Pulls out SWISS KNIFE to cut the plastic.

SAL: "What do you have cooking at the lab, Felix?"

      Felix struggles to light the cigar.

FELIX: "FUCK..."

      *thinks: that's the one I gave him*
      *Zippos not like they used to make them*

SAL: "If they have SOUNDCLOUD."

SAL: "And we were thinking Spotify..."

FELIX: "And Felix..."
FELIX: "I have FAIR PHONE."
FELIX: "No apples here."

      *they laugh*
