FOLLOW-UP COMMENT (reply to your own post):
-------------------------------------------
KEY TAKEAWAYS:

1. THE OLD SYSTEM (1945-now):
- China = factory
- Japan = lender
- Europe = consumer
- USA = enforcer (petro dollar + military)
Play by the rules or get sanctions/war.

2. THE 4 POWER PLAYERS:
- Asset Managers (BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street) - control $10T+ and 89% of shareholder votes
- Banks (JP Morgan, Central Banks) - want CBDCs to stay relevant
- Sovereigns (Putin, Xi) - want control of their own resources
- Military-Industrial Complex - enforcement layer

3. BEST QUOTES:
- Christine Lagarde: "I'm not going to tell you that central banks will always be around either."
- Jamie Diamond: "I'm a globalist."
- Larry Fink pushing tokenization = putting ALL assets on blockchain they control

4. THE THEORY:
"All of this has already been negotiated. What we're watching is political theater."
