00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,270

So, what I've been saying for a while

2
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:01,280
So, what I've been saying for a while
 

3
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,750
So, what I've been saying for a while
now is finally coming true. And what

4
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:03,760
now is finally coming true. And what
 

5
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,510
now is finally coming true. And what
we're seeing around the world is what's

6
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:05,520
we're seeing around the world is what's
 

7
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,950
we're seeing around the world is what's
called the end of globalization.

8
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:08,960
called the end of globalization.
 

9
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,110
called the end of globalization.

The world has changed much and I believe

16
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:20,560
The world has changed much and I believe
 

17
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,310
The world has changed much and I believe
the progress that we have made in the

18
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:22,320
the progress that we have made in the
 

19
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,150
the progress that we have made in the
partnership

sets us up well for the new world order.

22
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:31,359
sets us up well for the new world order.
 

23
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,270
sets us up well for the new world order.
Okay, so what does that mean? Well,

24
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,280
Okay, so what does that mean? Well,
 

25
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,549
Okay, so what does that mean? Well,
here's a very simple way of looking at

26
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:34,559
here's a very simple way of looking at
 

27
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,430
here's a very simple way of looking at
it. After World War II, the world came

28
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:37,440
it. After World War II, the world came
 

29
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,270
it. After World War II, the world came
to an agreement about how to structure

30
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,280
to an agreement about how to structure
 

31
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,510
to an agreement about how to structure
the new world order. China became the

32
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:41,520
the new world order. China became the
 

33
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,430
the new world order. China became the
factory of the world. Japan became the

34
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
factory of the world. Japan became the
 

35
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,510
factory of the world. Japan became the
lender by keeping rates at zero, keeping

36
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:45,520
lender by keeping rates at zero, keeping
 

37
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,910
lender by keeping rates at zero, keeping
the system liquid. Europe became the

38
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:47,920
the system liquid. Europe became the
 

39
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,229
the system liquid. Europe became the
buyer and consumer of the world. They

40
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:50,239
buyer and consumer of the world. They
 

41
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,150
buyer and consumer of the world. They
traded productivity and military for

42
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,160
traded productivity and military for
 

43
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,549
traded productivity and military for
stability and social welfare. And the

44
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:54,559
stability and social welfare. And the
 

45
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,150
stability and social welfare. And the
United States became the country that

46
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,160
United States became the country that
 

47
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,389
United States became the country that
enforced the whole thing with the petro

48
00:00:58,389 --> 00:00:58,399
enforced the whole thing with the petro
 

49
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,549
enforced the whole thing with the petro
dollar as the world's reserve currency

50
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:00,559
dollar as the world's reserve currency
 

51
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,950
dollar as the world's reserve currency
backed by the military-industrial

52
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:02,960
backed by the military-industrial
 

53
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,270
backed by the military-industrial
complex. Now that system is what Simon

54
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:05,280
complex. Now that system is what Simon
 

55
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,990
complex. Now that system is what Simon
Dixon coined as the proof of weapons

56
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,000
Dixon coined as the proof of weapons
 

57
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,950
Dixon coined as the proof of weapons
network which means if countries want to

58
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:10,960
network which means if countries want to
 

59
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,109
network which means if countries want to
trade or if they want money to build

60
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:13,119
trade or if they want money to build
 

61
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,670
trade or if they want money to build
their economies they have to agree to

62
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:15,680
their economies they have to agree to
 

63
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,270
their economies they have to agree to
the rules. The rules were use dollars to

64
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,280
the rules. The rules were use dollars to
 

65
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,910
the rules. The rules were use dollars to
buy energy and do not mess with US

66
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:21,920
buy energy and do not mess with US
 

67
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,390
buy energy and do not mess with US
interests. The petro dollar made sure

68
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:24,400
interests. The petro dollar made sure
 

69
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,630
interests. The petro dollar made sure
that the world needed dollars to buy its

70
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:26,640
that the world needed dollars to buy its
 

71
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,070
that the world needed dollars to buy its
energy. The military enforced it all and

72
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:30,080
energy. The military enforced it all and
 

73
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,830
energy. The military enforced it all and
financial institutions along with the

74
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:31,840
financial institutions along with the
 

75
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,469
financial institutions along with the
central banks managed the flow of all

76
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:34,479
central banks managed the flow of all
 

77
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,870
central banks managed the flow of all
this money. So if you play by the rules,

78
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:36,880
this money. So if you play by the rules,
 

79
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,870
this money. So if you play by the rules,
you got access to investment markets and

80
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:38,880
you got access to investment markets and
 

81
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,030
you got access to investment markets and
protection. And if you broke the rules,

82
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
protection. And if you broke the rules,
 

83
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,149
protection. And if you broke the rules,
you got punished with things like

84
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:42,159
you got punished with things like
 

85
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,429
you got punished with things like
sanctions or just outright war. Now, if

86
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:45,439
sanctions or just outright war. Now, if
 

87
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,670
sanctions or just outright war. Now, if
you're an American, depending on which

88
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:47,680
you're an American, depending on which
 

89
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,749
you're an American, depending on which
side of the K-shaped economy you were

90
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:49,759
side of the K-shaped economy you were
 

91
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,429
side of the K-shaped economy you were
on, rich or poor, then you indirectly

92
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:53,439
on, rich or poor, then you indirectly
 

93
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,990
on, rich or poor, then you indirectly
benefited from that system because US

94
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,000
benefited from that system because US
 

95
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,830
benefited from that system because US
companies made a lot of money. And if

96
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
companies made a lot of money. And if
 

97
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,069
companies made a lot of money. And if
you were an investor, you also made a

98
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:00,079
you were an investor, you also made a
 

99
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,990
you were an investor, you also made a
lot of money and you got to retire

100
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:02,000
lot of money and you got to retire
 

101
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,749
lot of money and you got to retire
happy. The downside though was that to

102
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759
happy. The downside though was that to
 

103
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,550
happy. The downside though was that to
keep this system going, it doesn't just

104
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
keep this system going, it doesn't just
 

105
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,910
keep this system going, it doesn't just
take a war, it takes a forever war,

106
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
take a war, it takes a forever war,
 

107
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,070
take a war, it takes a forever war,
which is bad for the world. Now, if

108
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,080
which is bad for the world. Now, if
 

109
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,430
which is bad for the world. Now, if
you're poor as an American, it's

110
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:15,440
you're poor as an American, it's
 

111
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,350
you're poor as an American, it's
especially bad because the system gave

112
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360
especially bad because the system gave
 

113
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,830
especially bad because the system gave
out all the jobs. Supply chains left,

114
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:19,840
out all the jobs. Supply chains left,
 

115
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,190
out all the jobs. Supply chains left,
factories left, and what it did was it

116
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,200
factories left, and what it did was it
 

117
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,350
factories left, and what it did was it
concentrated wealth. It hollowed out the

118
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,360
concentrated wealth. It hollowed out the
 

119
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,510
concentrated wealth. It hollowed out the
middle class, and it created a very

120
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:27,520
middle class, and it created a very
 

121
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,229
middle class, and it created a very
fragile dependency on other nations for

122
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:30,239
fragile dependency on other nations for
 

123
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,110
fragile dependency on other nations for
their stuff. Cuz America stopped making

124
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,120
their stuff. Cuz America stopped making
 

125
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,430
their stuff. Cuz America stopped making
stuff. The only thing America made was

126
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,440
stuff. The only thing America made was
 

127
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,990
stuff. The only thing America made was
money and technology. And for a long

128
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,000
money and technology. And for a long
 

129
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,270
money and technology. And for a long
time, that's how the world worked.

130
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,280
time, that's how the world worked.
 

131
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,270
time, that's how the world worked.
Technically, it still does. at least on

132
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,280
Technically, it still does. at least on
 

133
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,670
Technically, it still does. at least on
paper, but it's coming to the end

134
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:45,680
paper, but it's coming to the end
 

135
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,869
paper, but it's coming to the end
because fast forward to today and some

136
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:48,879
because fast forward to today and some
 

137
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,630
because fast forward to today and some
of these nations decided to team up and

138
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,640
of these nations decided to team up and
 

139
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,270
of these nations decided to team up and
said, "Okay, we'll make our own system

140
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
said, "Okay, we'll make our own system
 

141
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,750
said, "Okay, we'll make our own system
then." And they've become so powerful at

then." And they've become so powerful at
 

143
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,830
then." And they've become so powerful at
this point that the proof of weapons

144
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
this point that the proof of weapons
 

145
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,790
this point that the proof of weapons
network cannot enforce the rules anymore

146
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
network cannot enforce the rules anymore
 

147
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,270
network cannot enforce the rules anymore
without going to World War II, which no

148
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,280
without going to World War II, which no
 

149
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,670
without going to World War II, which no
one wants. And at the most recent

199
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,630
your military, well then you've got no
power to enforce the rules. So what

200
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
power to enforce the rules. So what
 

201
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,190
power to enforce the rules. So what
we're left with is what was talked about

202
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,200
we're left with is what was talked about
 

203
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,670
we're left with is what was talked about
at this World Economic Forum. The

204
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:13,680
at this World Economic Forum. The
 

205
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,110
at this World Economic Forum. The
question was, how do we divide power in

206
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,120
question was, how do we divide power in
 

207
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,349
question was, how do we divide power in
this new world order? That's what I want

208
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:19,359
this new world order? That's what I want
 

209
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,949
this new world order? That's what I want
to help explain. I want to show you who

210
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:20,959
to help explain. I want to show you who
 

211
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,710
to help explain. I want to show you who
the players are, what each of them

212
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720
the players are, what each of them
 

213
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,950
the players are, what each of them
wants, and what it might look like in

214
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:24,960
wants, and what it might look like in
 

215
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,270
wants, and what it might look like in
the future. So, with that said, let's

216
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,280
the future. So, with that said, let's
 

217
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,510
the future. So, with that said, let's
get into it. Hi, my name is Andre Jick.

218
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:29,520
get into it. Hi, my name is Andre Jick.
 

219
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,629
get into it. Hi, my name is Andre Jick.
Hope you're doing well. Come for the

220
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:30,639
Hope you're doing well. Come for the
 

221
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,230
Hope you're doing well. Come for the
finance and stay for the new world

222
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
finance and stay for the new world
 

223
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,189
finance and stay for the new world
order. So, the old game that's been

224
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
order. So, the old game that's been
 

225
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,510
order. So, the old game that's been
played since World War II for about 80

226
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:37,520
played since World War II for about 80
 

227
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,550
played since World War II for about 80
years or so is coming to an end. And it

228
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:40,560
years or so is coming to an end. And it
 

229
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,749
years or so is coming to an end. And it
kind of perfectly lines up with

230
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:41,759
kind of perfectly lines up with
 

231
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,510
kind of perfectly lines up with
something called the fourth turning,

232
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
something called the fourth turning,
 

233
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,189
something called the fourth turning,
which is a model that shows that every

234
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:45,199
which is a model that shows that every
 

235
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,350
which is a model that shows that every
20 years we've got a new cycle which

236
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
20 years we've got a new cycle which
 

237
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,749
20 years we've got a new cycle which
starts with the high followed by the

238
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:49,759
starts with the high followed by the
 

239
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,310
starts with the high followed by the
awakening, then the unraveling, and now

240
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,320
awakening, then the unraveling, and now
 

241
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,189
awakening, then the unraveling, and now
the crisis or the reset. That's where

242
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:55,199
the crisis or the reset. That's where
 

243
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,030
the crisis or the reset. That's where
the World Economic Forum in Davos,

244
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,040
the World Economic Forum in Davos,
 

245
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,150
the World Economic Forum in Davos,
Switzerland, comes in. This is where the

246
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
Switzerland, comes in. This is where the
 

247
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,310
Switzerland, comes in. This is where the
world's most powerful people get

248
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,320
world's most powerful people get
 

249
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,350
world's most powerful people get
together to talk about what the new game

250
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
together to talk about what the new game
 

251
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,590
together to talk about what the new game
is going to look like. This is the

252
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
is going to look like. This is the
 

253
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,590
is going to look like. This is the
largest gathering of global leadership

254
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
largest gathering of global leadership
 

255
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,390
largest gathering of global leadership
of the postcoid period of time.

256
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,400
of the postcoid period of time.
 

257
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,749
of the postcoid period of time.

This gets very complex. There's all

262
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:20,800
This gets very complex. There's all
 

263
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,629
This gets very complex. There's all
kinds of different power structures with

264
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
kinds of different power structures with
 

265
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,629
kinds of different power structures with
different incentives, pulling in all

different incentives, pulling in all

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,950
different incentives, pulling in all
different directions, all trying to take

a piece of whatever replaces this old
 

271
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,790
a piece of whatever replaces this old
system. So, let me give you a high-level

272
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:32,800
system. So, let me give you a high-level
 

273
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,749
system. So, let me give you a high-level
condensed overview of what's happening.

274
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759
condensed overview of what's happening.
 

275
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,310
condensed overview of what's happening.
Now there are technically four groups of

276
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:38,320
Now there are technically four groups of
 

277
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,070
Now there are technically four groups of
power. The first group is what we can

278
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
power. The first group is what we can
 

279
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,150
power. The first group is what we can
call the financial globalists. Some

280
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
call the financial globalists. Some
 

281
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,390
call the financial globalists. Some
people call it the transnational

282
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,400
people call it the transnational
 

283
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,270
people call it the transnational
capital. Why is it called that? It's

284
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:49,280
capital. Why is it called that? It's
 

285
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,590
capital. Why is it called that? It's
called that because transnational

286
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
called that because transnational
 

287
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,629
called that because transnational
capital means these people do not pledge

288
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
capital means these people do not pledge
 

289
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,950
capital means these people do not pledge
allegiance to a flag. They don't

290
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
allegiance to a flag. They don't
 

291
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,150
allegiance to a flag. They don't
represent a nation's interests. They are

292
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,160
represent a nation's interests. They are
 

293
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,870
represent a nation's interests. They are
money and money can be anywhere. Hence,

294
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
money and money can be anywhere. Hence,
 

295
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,670
money and money can be anywhere. Hence,
transnational because it transcends

296
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
transnational because it transcends
 

297
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,150
transnational because it transcends
nations. So, who are these people? Who

298
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
nations. So, who are these people? Who
 

299
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,469
nations. So, who are these people? Who
am I talking about? Well, at the very

300
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:10,479
am I talking about? Well, at the very
 

301
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,070
am I talking about? Well, at the very
top, these are the asset managers. And

302
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080
top, these are the asset managers. And
 

303
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,990
top, these are the asset managers. And
at the top of that food chain are three

304
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,000
at the top of that food chain are three
 

305
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,309
at the top of that food chain are three
specific ones. They're the apex

306
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:18,319
specific ones. They're the apex
 

307
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,550
specific ones. They're the apex
predators of this structure. And that is

308
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
predators of this structure. And that is
 

309
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,790
predators of this structure. And that is
Black Rockck, Vanguard, and State

310
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
Black Rockck, Vanguard, and State
 

311

Street, which together manage tens of
trillions of dollars. Now they thrive in

314
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919
trillions of dollars. Now they thrive in
 

315
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,590
trillions of dollars. Now they thrive in
a world where money or capital can move

316
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:31,600
a world where money or capital can move
 

317
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,710
a world where money or capital can move
anywhere, any place, any time. Now that

318
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
anywhere, any place, any time. Now that
 

319
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,629
anywhere, any place, any time. Now that
money is not their money obviously, it's

320
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:36,639
money is not their money obviously, it's
 

321
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,950
money is not their money obviously, it's
their client's money. But with that

322
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:38,960
their client's money. But with that
 

323
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,070
their client's money. But with that
money, they are given a superpower.

324
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,080
money, they are given a superpower.
 

325
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,150
money, they are given a superpower.
That superpower is that all corporations

326
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
That superpower is that all corporations
 

327
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,950
That superpower is that all corporations
around the world become subordinate to

328
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:48,960
around the world become subordinate to
 

329
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,469
around the world become subordinate to
them. How? Well, because corporations

330
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:52,479
them. How? Well, because corporations
 

331
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,070
them. How? Well, because corporations
optimize for access to capital or money.

332
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,080
optimize for access to capital or money.
 

333
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,710
optimize for access to capital or money.
And through that, asset managers get to

334
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:58,720
And through that, asset managers get to
 

335
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,309
And through that, asset managers get to
vote on behalf of their shareholders.

336
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:00,319
vote on behalf of their shareholders.
 

337
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,589
vote on behalf of their shareholders.
And here's an example of what I mean,

338
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:01,599
And here's an example of what I mean,
 

339
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,270
And here's an example of what I mean,
cuz I know it sounds confusing. If

340
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,280
cuz I know it sounds confusing. If
 

341
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,270
cuz I know it sounds confusing. If
you're buying mutual funds or ETFs at a

342
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,280
you're buying mutual funds or ETFs at a
 

343
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,350
you're buying mutual funds or ETFs at a
place like Black Rockck, your money is

344
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:07,360
place like Black Rockck, your money is
 

345
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,189
place like Black Rockck, your money is
being allocated to different types of

346
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:09,199
being allocated to different types of
 

347
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,749
being allocated to different types of
funds, but you don't get to vote on what

348
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:11,759
funds, but you don't get to vote on what
 

349
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,589
funds, but you don't get to vote on what
the individual companies within those

350
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:13,599
the individual companies within those
 

351
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,990
the individual companies within those
funds get to do. Now, you can vote with

352
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
funds get to do. Now, you can vote with
 

353
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,230
funds get to do. Now, you can vote with
some funds, but the reality is this

354
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,240
some funds, but the reality is this
 

355
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,070
some funds, but the reality is this
chart right here is that most people

356
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
chart right here is that most people
 

357
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,990
chart right here is that most people
won't even bother at all. And this chart

358
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,000
won't even bother at all. And this chart
 

359
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,430
won't even bother at all. And this chart
right here is from Black Rockck's

360
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,440
right here is from Black Rockck's
 

361
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,430
right here is from Black Rockck's
website, which actually shows that in

362
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,440
website, which actually shows that in
 

363
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,589
website, which actually shows that in
2025, out of the 7.4 trillion in total

364
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:29,599
2025, out of the 7.4 trillion in total
 

365
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,350
2025, out of the 7.4 trillion in total
index equity, only 3.65 trillion was

366
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:33,360
index equity, only 3.65 trillion was
 

367
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,710
index equity, only 3.65 trillion was
even eligible for voting. But of that,

368
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:36,720
even eligible for voting. But of that,
 

369
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,790
even eligible for voting. But of that,
only 812 billion actually voted. That's

370
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800
only 812 billion actually voted. That's
 

371
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,469
only 812 billion actually voted. That's
only 11% of total index equity, which

372
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
only 11% of total index equity, which
 

373
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,230
only 11% of total index equity, which
means 89% of their clients votes was

374
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,240
means 89% of their clients votes was
 

375
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,390
means 89% of their clients votes was
exercised by Black Rockck, not by their

376
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
exercised by Black Rockck, not by their
 

377
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,469
exercised by Black Rockck, not by their
clients. So even though asset managers

378
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:52,479
clients. So even though asset managers
 

379
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,710
clients. So even though asset managers
don't own the money they manage, they

380
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:54,720
don't own the money they manage, they
 

381
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,589
don't own the money they manage, they
are using their clients money to vote

382
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:57,599
are using their clients money to vote
 

383
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,990
are using their clients money to vote
which way a company goes and who those

384
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,000
which way a company goes and who those
 

385
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,670
which way a company goes and who those
companies hire for their members of the

386
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:01,680
companies hire for their members of the
 

387
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,390
companies hire for their members of the
board. Now downstream from that is

388
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:04,400
board. Now downstream from that is
 

389
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,629
board. Now downstream from that is
everything else like access to capital,

390
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:06,639
everything else like access to capital,
 

391
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,070
everything else like access to capital,
access to markets and all the other

392
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,080
access to markets and all the other
 

393
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,749
access to markets and all the other
things. That's why Larry Frink is at the

394
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:11,759
things. That's why Larry Frink is at the
 

395
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,550
things. That's why Larry Frink is at the
top of this food chain. He is the top G

396
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:14,560
top of this food chain. He is the top G
 

397
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,710
top of this food chain. He is the top G
here. And what you have to understand

398
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:16,720
here. And what you have to understand
 

399
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,430
here. And what you have to understand
about this power structure is that it it

400
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,440
about this power structure is that it it
 

401
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,670
about this power structure is that it it
does not need to pass laws or control

402
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:21,680
does not need to pass laws or control
 

403
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,150
does not need to pass laws or control
the military because by controlling

404
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,160
the military because by controlling
 

405
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,430
the military because by controlling
capital flows, they're able to guide

406
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,440
capital flows, they're able to guide
 

407
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,909
capital flows, they're able to guide
most of the decisions because if you're

408
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:29,919
most of the decisions because if you're
 

409
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,310
most of the decisions because if you're
the CEO of a company and the money flows

410
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:32,320
the CEO of a company and the money flows
 

411
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,110
the CEO of a company and the money flows
to you, well then your company grows.

412
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:35,120
to you, well then your company grows.
 

413
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,790
to you, well then your company grows.
But if it leaves and you get kicked out

414
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:36,800
But if it leaves and you get kicked out
 

415
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,709
But if it leaves and you get kicked out
of the index, well then your company

416
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:38,719
of the index, well then your company
 

417
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,269
of the index, well then your company
gets smaller and you get fired. So if

418
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:41,279
gets smaller and you get fired. So if
 

419
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,430
gets smaller and you get fired. So if
you want to succeed, then you're going

420
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:43,440
you want to succeed, then you're going
 

421
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,509
you want to succeed, then you're going
to probably do as you're told, and that

422
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:45,519
to probably do as you're told, and that
 

423
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,389
to probably do as you're told, and that
is the ultimate superpower. Now, I

424
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
is the ultimate superpower. Now, I
 

425
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,670
is the ultimate superpower. Now, I
should also mention though that there's

426
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:49,680
should also mention though that there's
 

427
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,630
should also mention though that there's
not just one apex predator here. There's

428
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,640
not just one apex predator here. There's
 

429
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,190
not just one apex predator here. There's
another one, and that's the banks and

430
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,200
another one, and that's the banks and
 

431
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,150
another one, and that's the banks and
the Federal Reserve. So asset managers

432
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,160
the Federal Reserve. So asset managers
 

433
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,230
the Federal Reserve. So asset managers
and banks, I believe, are separate

434
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,240
and banks, I believe, are separate
 

435
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,430
and banks, I believe, are separate
players with their own unique interests.

436
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,440
players with their own unique interests.
 

437
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,949
players with their own unique interests.
And I think you can tell that from this

438
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:04,959
And I think you can tell that from this
 

439
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,870
And I think you can tell that from this
conversation between Larry Frink and

440
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:06,880
conversation between Larry Frink and
 

441
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,509
conversation between Larry Frink and
Christine Lagarde where she drops a hint

442
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
Christine Lagarde where she drops a hint
 

443
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,470
Christine Lagarde where she drops a hint
that central banks might not always be

444
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:12,480
that central banks might not always be
 

445
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,030
that central banks might not always be
around.

446
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,040
around.
 

447
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,230
around.
>> So I'm not going to tell you that there

448
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,240
>> So I'm not going to tell you that there
 

449
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,990
>> So I'm not going to tell you that there
is a red line. I'm not going to tell you

450
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,000
is a red line. I'm not going to tell you
 

451
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,829
is a red line. I'm not going to tell you
that central banks will always be around

452
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:17,839
that central banks will always be around
 

453
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:18,550
that central banks will always be around
either.

454
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
either.
 

455
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,070
either.
>> Speak to what you did. You just said

456
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,080
>> Speak to what you did. You just said
 

457
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,949
>> Speak to what you did. You just said
something very interesting.

458
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959
something very interesting.
 

459
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,150
something very interesting.
>> I'm not going to speak more to it.

460
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,160
>> I'm not going to speak more to it.
 

461
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,350
>> I'm not going to speak more to it.
>> No. To this [laughter]

462
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,360
>> No. To this [laughter]
 

463
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,750
>> No. To this [laughter]
to no to the idea that central banks

464
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,760
to no to the idea that central banks
 

465
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,990
to no to the idea that central banks
might not always be around. What did you

466
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,000
might not always be around. What did you
 

467
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,790
might not always be around. What did you
mean by that? Look, I went through uh my

468
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800
mean by that? Look, I went through uh my
 

469
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,630
mean by that? Look, I went through uh my
lot of crisis as many of you have as

470
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640
lot of crisis as many of you have as
 

471
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,710
lot of crisis as many of you have as

meaning those with access to nuclear

weapons. Now, a sovereign is someone
 

553
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,269
weapons. Now, a sovereign is someone

that believes globalization is a threat
 

555

is not necessarily trying to win the

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,750
is not necessarily trying to win the

globalization game. They're just trying
 

561
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,230
globalization game. They're just trying
not to lose control. And their power

562
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:10,240
not to lose control. And their power
 

563
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,870
not to lose control. And their power
comes from things like laws, borders,

564
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:12,880
comes from things like laws, borders,
 

565
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,310
comes from things like laws, borders,
tariffs, and sometimes they're even

tariffs, and sometimes they're even

their sovereignty, their independence.

their sovereignty, their independence.
and they're willing to put up with some

572
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,040
and they're willing to put up with some
 

573
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,710
and they're willing to put up with some
economic pain not to lose control over

00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:24,720
economic pain not to lose control over
 

575
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,230
economic pain not to lose control over
industry, energy, and security. Now, who

industry, energy, and security. Now, who

are they specifically, right? Well, that
 

579
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,269
are they specifically, right? Well, that
might be someone like Vladimir Putin,

580
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:33,279
might be someone like Vladimir Putin,
 

581
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,550
might be someone like Vladimir Putin,
right? A guy who doesn't want to

00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:34,560
right? A guy who doesn't want to
 

583
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,350
right? A guy who doesn't want to
privatize his nation's resources. He

584
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,360
privatize his nation's resources. He
 

585
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,430
privatize his nation's resources. He
doesn't care if Russia's stock market

00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,440
doesn't care if Russia's stock market
 

587
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,230
doesn't care if Russia's stock market
isn't doing all that great. He wants it

588
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,240
isn't doing all that great. He wants it
 

589
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,150
isn't doing all that great. He wants it
so that only the Russian government can

590
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160
so that only the Russian government can
 

591
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,790
so that only the Russian government can
drill for his oil and not Exon Mobile or

592
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:46,800
drill for his oil and not Exon Mobile or
 

593
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,630
drill for his oil and not Exon Mobile or
Chevron. He doesn't really care if

594
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:48,640
Chevron. He doesn't really care if
 

595
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,350
Chevron. He doesn't really care if
Russian stocks underperform US markets.

596
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,360
Russian stocks underperform US markets.
 

597
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,949
Russian stocks underperform US markets.
And sovereigns also don't care if the

And sovereigns also don't care if the
 

599
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,310

rest of the world doesn't really want to

rest of the world doesn't really want to
 

601
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,230
rest of the world doesn't really want to
play with them, right? Same can be said

602
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
play with them, right? Same can be said
 

603
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,430
play with them, right? Same can be said
of China's Xi Jinping. He prefers state

604
00:11:59,430 --> 00:11:59,440
of China's Xi Jinping. He prefers state
 

605
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,710
of China's Xi Jinping. He prefers state
control and long-term growth over access

00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:02,720
control and long-term growth over access
 

607
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,829
control and long-term growth over access
to Western capital. Same can also be

608
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:05,839
to Western capital. Same can also be
 

609
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,069
to Western capital. Same can also be
said of North Korea's Kim Jong-un. Same

610
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:08,079
said of North Korea's Kim Jong-un. Same
 

611
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,110
said of North Korea's Kim Jong-un. Same
same but different. Sovereign power

612
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,120
same but different. Sovereign power
 

613
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,829
same but different. Sovereign power
resists globalization cuz they know they

614
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:13,839
resists globalization cuz they know they
 

615
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,910
resists globalization cuz they know they
cannot win this game. And that's also

616
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:15,920
cannot win this game. And that's also
 

617
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,910
cannot win this game. And that's also
why the financial industrial complex

618
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:17,920
why the financial industrial complex
 

619
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,910
why the financial industrial complex
hates them so much because they're

620
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:19,920
hates them so much because they're
 

621
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,389
hates them so much because they're
unpredictable and they are inefficient

622
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:22,399
unpredictable and they are inefficient
 

623
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,310
unpredictable and they are inefficient
from a capital point of view. But

624
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:26,320
from a capital point of view. But
 

625
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,310
from a capital point of view. But
they're popular and their voters keep

626
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
they're popular and their voters keep
 

627
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,750
they're popular and their voters keep
choosing them because they promise

628
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:29,760
choosing them because they promise
 

629
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,389
choosing them because they promise
control and obedience. They have clean

630
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:32,399
control and obedience. They have clean
 

631
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,710
control and obedience. They have clean
streets, right? They have order which is

632
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:34,720
streets, right? They have order which is
 

633
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,870
streets, right? They have order which is
very efficient. So their people really

634
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:36,880
very efficient. So their people really
 

635
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,190
very efficient. So their people really
love them. So in a nutshell they

636
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,200
love them. So in a nutshell they
 

637
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,069
love them. So in a nutshell they
understand that to allow transnational

638
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:42,079
understand that to allow transnational
 

639
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,310
understand that to allow transnational
capital in their countries would mean

640
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,320
capital in their countries would mean
 

641
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,069
capital in their countries would mean
giving up all the leverage that they

642
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:46,079
giving up all the leverage that they
 

643
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,110
giving up all the leverage that they
have. Now the third group are the

644
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,120
have. Now the third group are the
 

645
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,870
have. Now the third group are the
technologists sometimes called the

646
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:50,880
technologists sometimes called the
 

647
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,190
technologists sometimes called the
technocrats and they don't really care

648
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:53,200
technocrats and they don't really care
 

649
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,310
technocrats and they don't really care
about nationalism versus globalism. They

650
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
about nationalism versus globalism. They
 

651
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,990
about nationalism versus globalism. They
mostly care about things like

652
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,000
mostly care about things like
 

653
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,350
mostly care about things like
efficiency, scale and networks. They

654
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:01,360
efficiency, scale and networks. They
 

655
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,110
efficiency, scale and networks. They
believe that technology will someday

656
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,120
believe that technology will someday
 

657
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,230
believe that technology will someday
replace or automate a lot of what

658
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,240
replace or automate a lot of what
 

659
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,990
replace or automate a lot of what
governments and institutions are doing

660
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,000
governments and institutions are doing
 

661
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,829
governments and institutions are doing
right now. But I also think it's

662
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:09,839
right now. But I also think it's
 

663
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,110
right now. But I also think it's
important to understand that

664
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:11,120
important to understand that
 

665
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,110
important to understand that
technologists are not necessarily at the

666
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,120
technologists are not necessarily at the
 

667
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,430
technologists are not necessarily at the
top of the power structure. They don't

668
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:15,440
top of the power structure. They don't
 

669
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,910
top of the power structure. They don't
control the capital flows. They can work

670
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:17,920
control the capital flows. They can work
 

671
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,870
control the capital flows. They can work
with almost any player in the system as

672
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:20,880
with almost any player in the system as
 

673
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,069
with almost any player in the system as
long as they are given funding, access

674
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:24,079
long as they are given funding, access
 

675
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,949
long as they are given funding, access
to data, and the permission. Right? In

676
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:26,959
to data, and the permission. Right? In
 

677
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,269
to data, and the permission. Right? In
that sense, they're also transnational

678
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:29,279
that sense, they're also transnational
 

679
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,269
that sense, they're also transnational
because their software goes beyond their

680
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:31,279
because their software goes beyond their
 

681
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,710
because their software goes beyond their
borders. And as globalization breaks

682
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:34,720
borders. And as globalization breaks
 

683
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,190
borders. And as globalization breaks
down, they kind of get more powerful,

684
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:37,200
down, they kind of get more powerful,
 

685
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,629
down, they kind of get more powerful,
right? How? Well, because financial

686
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:40,639
right? How? Well, because financial
 

687
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,470
right? How? Well, because financial
power pushes for programmable money,

688
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:44,480
power pushes for programmable money,
 

689
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,629
power pushes for programmable money,
digital IDs, social credit scores,

690
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:46,639
digital IDs, social credit scores,
 

691
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,230
digital IDs, social credit scores,
automation, robots, etc. Right? So, the

692
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,240
automation, robots, etc. Right? So, the
 

693
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,629
automation, robots, etc. Right? So, the
capital moves in their direction and

694
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:52,639
capital moves in their direction and
 

695
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,790
capital moves in their direction and
they get more powerful. They have a lot

696
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:54,800
they get more powerful. They have a lot
 

697
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,949
they get more powerful. They have a lot
of leverage but they're not quite the

698
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:56,959
of leverage but they're not quite the
 

699
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,670
of leverage but they're not quite the
most powerful as the financial players

700
00:13:59,670 --> 00:13:59,680
most powerful as the financial players
 

701
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,470
most powerful as the financial players
are in this structure. Now then there's

702
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:02,480
are in this structure. Now then there's
 

703
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,069
are in this structure. Now then there's
the fourth group though which is the

704
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:04,079
the fourth group though which is the
 

705
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,550
the fourth group though which is the
military-industrial complex and this is

706
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:06,560
military-industrial complex and this is
 

707
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,790
military-industrial complex and this is
sort of like the enforcement layer.

708
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:08,800
sort of like the enforcement layer.
 

709
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,670
sort of like the enforcement layer.
Their power comes from force and the

710
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:11,680
Their power comes from force and the
 

711
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,829
Their power comes from force and the
intelligence agencies. They thrive

712
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:13,839
intelligence agencies. They thrive
 

713
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,189
intelligence agencies. They thrive
mostly on instability and their role is

714
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:17,199
mostly on instability and their role is
 

715
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,590
mostly on instability and their role is
just to enforce whatever system is in

716
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:19,600
just to enforce whatever system is in
 

717
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,829
just to enforce whatever system is in
place right now. They're not really

718
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:21,839
place right now. They're not really
 

719
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,350
place right now. They're not really
subordinate to the government like you

720
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:23,360
subordinate to the government like you
 

721
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,590
subordinate to the government like you
might think. They're more subordinate to

722
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:25,600
might think. They're more subordinate to
 

723
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,990
might think. They're more subordinate to
the financial industrial complex because

724
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,000
the financial industrial complex because
 

725
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,310
the financial industrial complex because
it's the financial powers that dominate

726
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:30,320
it's the financial powers that dominate
 

727
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,310
it's the financial powers that dominate
the government, not the other way

728
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:32,320
the government, not the other way
 

729
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,990
the government, not the other way
around. Okay. So, now that you hopefully

730
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,000
around. Okay. So, now that you hopefully
 

731
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,230
around. Okay. So, now that you hopefully
understand who the players are, the next

732
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:36,240
understand who the players are, the next
 

733
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,350
understand who the players are, the next
question is what do they actually want?

734
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,360
question is what do they actually want?
 

735
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,750
question is what do they actually want?
So, let me start with the most powerful

736
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:41,760
So, let me start with the most powerful
 

737
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,030
So, let me start with the most powerful
group of them all, which is the

738
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,040
group of them all, which is the
 

739
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,430
group of them all, which is the
financial industrial complex. Now, one

740
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:45,440
financial industrial complex. Now, one
 

741
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,389
financial industrial complex. Now, one
of those players, the asset managers,

742
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:48,399
of those players, the asset managers,
 

743
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,990
of those players, the asset managers,
what they want is a world where money or

744
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
what they want is a world where money or
 

745
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,350
what they want is a world where money or
capital stays liquid, fast, and

746
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
capital stays liquid, fast, and
 

747
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,310
capital stays liquid, fast, and
controllable even if nations and

748
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:58,320
controllable even if nations and
 

749
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,949
controllable even if nations and
countries fragment, right? Because

750
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:00,959
countries fragment, right? Because
 

751
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,509
countries fragment, right? Because
delobalization is a problem for them

752
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:03,519
delobalization is a problem for them
 

753
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,550
delobalization is a problem for them
because borders slow money down.

754
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:06,560
because borders slow money down.
 

755
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,230
because borders slow money down.
Different countries have different

756
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:08,240
Different countries have different
 

757
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,910
Different countries have different
rules, [music] different currencies,

758
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:09,920
rules, [music] different currencies,
 

759
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,150
rules, [music] different currencies,
different settlement systems. And all of

760
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,160
different settlement systems. And all of
 

761
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,189
different settlement systems. And all of
that is what's called friction. It adds

762
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:15,199
that is what's called friction. It adds
 

763
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,590
that is what's called friction. It adds
cost and complexity and all the stuff

764
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:17,600
cost and complexity and all the stuff
 

765
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,509
cost and complexity and all the stuff
they don't want to deal with. So their

766
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:19,519
they don't want to deal with. So their
 

767
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,389
they don't want to deal with. So their
solution then is tokenization and

768
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:22,399
solution then is tokenization and
 

769
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,150
solution then is tokenization and
fractionalization, which is something

770
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,160
fractionalization, which is something
 

771
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,170
fractionalization, which is something

assets like stocks, bonds, real estate,

790
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:46,800
assets like stocks, bonds, real estate,
 

791
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,269
assets like stocks, bonds, real estate,
commodities, whatever and putting them

792
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:49,279
commodities, whatever and putting them
 

793
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,189
commodities, whatever and putting them
on a blockchain so they can trade

794
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:51,199
on a blockchain so they can trade
 

795
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,389
on a blockchain so they can trade
instantly globally 24/7. And

796
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:54,399
instantly globally 24/7. And
 

797
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,949
instantly globally 24/7. And
fractionalization means breaking those

798
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:56,959
fractionalization means breaking those
 

799
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,749
fractionalization means breaking those
assets into smaller pieces so that more

800
00:15:59,749 --> 00:15:59,759
assets into smaller pieces so that more
 

801
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,269
assets into smaller pieces so that more
people can own them and they can move

802
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:01,279
people can own them and they can move
 

803
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,790
people can own them and they can move
them faster. So now you can live

804
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:02,800
them faster. So now you can live
 

805
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,710
them faster. So now you can live
anywhere in the world and regardless of

806
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:04,720
anywhere in the world and regardless of
 

807

anywhere in the world and regardless of
which country you come from, anyone can

which country you come from, anyone can
 

809
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,749
which country you come from, anyone can
buy stocks from anywhere in the world,

810
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:09,759
buy stocks from anywhere in the world,
 

811
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,150
buy stocks from anywhere in the world,
right? But what that also does in

812
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,160
right? But what that also does in
 

813
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,790
right? But what that also does in
practice is that it hugely benefits

814
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:14,800
practice is that it hugely benefits
 

815
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,310
practice is that it hugely benefits
whoever controls the rails now. Asset

tokenization

820
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,040
tokenization
 

821
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,710
tokenization
allows them to control the

822
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:24,720
allows them to control the
 

823
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,189
allows them to control the
infrastructure as well. And in the

824
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:27,199
infrastructure as well. And in the
 

825
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,230
infrastructure as well. And in the
future, AI is going to play a huge role

826
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:30,240
future, AI is going to play a huge role
 

827
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,949
future, AI is going to play a huge role
in managing this whole system. And

828
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:32,959
in managing this whole system. And
 

829
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,430
in managing this whole system. And
because it's on the blockchain rail,

830
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:35,440
because it's on the blockchain rail,
 

831
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,269
because it's on the blockchain rail,
they're going to have all the tools in

832
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:37,279
they're going to have all the tools in
 

833
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,590
they're going to have all the tools in
the world to see everything that's

834
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:39,600
the world to see everything that's
 

835
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,749
the world to see everything that's
happening in real time. And they'll be

836
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:41,759
happening in real time. And they'll be
 

837
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,710
happening in real time. And they'll be
able to take advantage of that

838
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:42,720
able to take advantage of that
 

839
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,949
able to take advantage of that
information for better or for worse. But

840
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:44,959
information for better or for worse. But
 

841
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,629
information for better or for worse. But
remember, there's also the bankers. And

842
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:46,639
remember, there's also the bankers. And
 

843
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,350
remember, there's also the bankers. And
what do the banks want? Well, preferably

844
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:49,360
what do the banks want? Well, preferably
 

845
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,509
what do the banks want? Well, preferably
to kind of keep it all the same. But

846
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:51,519
to kind of keep it all the same. But
 

847
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,990
to kind of keep it all the same. But
really their biggest goal right now is

848
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,000
really their biggest goal right now is
 

849
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,389
really their biggest goal right now is
to avoid the privatization of money.

850
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:58,399
to avoid the privatization of money.
 

851
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,749
to avoid the privatization of money.
Here's one of the central bankers at

852
00:16:59,749 --> 00:16:59,759
Here's one of the central bankers at
 

853
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,670
Here's one of the central bankers at
Davos saying exactly this.

854
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:01,680
Davos saying exactly this.
 

855
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,910
Davos saying exactly this.
>> As I am a central banker, let me insist

856
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:03,920
>> As I am a central banker, let me insist
 

857
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,110
>> As I am a central banker, let me insist
a bit on at least I I gave a speech two

858
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:07,120
a bit on at least I I gave a speech two
 

859
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,110
a bit on at least I I gave a speech two
weeks ago with a triangle of threats and

860
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,120
weeks ago with a triangle of threats and
 

861
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,669
weeks ago with a triangle of threats and
a triangle of answer. But let me sum up.

862
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:11,679
a triangle of answer. But let me sum up.
 

863
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,150
a triangle of answer. But let me sum up.
The first threat is privatization of

864
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,160
The first threat is privatization of
 

865
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,110
The first threat is privatization of
money. So in other words, they want to

866
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,120
money. So in other words, they want to
 

867
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,870
money. So in other words, they want to
not be what's called disintermediated,

868
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:20,880
not be what's called disintermediated,
 

869
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,110
not be what's called disintermediated,
meaning they don't want to be cut out of

870
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:23,120
meaning they don't want to be cut out of
 

871
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,189
meaning they don't want to be cut out of
the capital flows. They don't want to be

872
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:25,199
the capital flows. They don't want to be
 

873
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,829
the capital flows. They don't want to be
made irrelevant. How do they do that?

874
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:27,839
made irrelevant. How do they do that?
 

875
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,029
made irrelevant. How do they do that?
>> Here's the answer is CBDC.

876
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:31,039
>> Here's the answer is CBDC.
 

877
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,549
>> Here's the answer is CBDC.
central bank digital currencies, CBDC's.

878
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:34,559
central bank digital currencies, CBDC's.
 

879
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,430
central bank digital currencies, CBDC's.
This is how the old system is trying to

880
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,440
This is how the old system is trying to
 

881
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,669
This is how the old system is trying to
stay relevant because if cash is

882
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:39,679
stay relevant because if cash is
 

883
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,909
stay relevant because if cash is
disappearing, if private payment rails

884
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:41,919
disappearing, if private payment rails
 

885
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,870
disappearing, if private payment rails
are taking over, if tokenized assets are

886
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:44,880
are taking over, if tokenized assets are
 

887
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,430
are taking over, if tokenized assets are
routing around them and asset managers

888
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,440
routing around them and asset managers
 

889
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,070
routing around them and asset managers
are building this new infrastructure

890
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,080
are building this new infrastructure
 

891
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,310
are building this new infrastructure
without the banks, well, that shrinks

892
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,320
without the banks, well, that shrinks
 

893
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,990
without the banks, well, that shrinks
the power of the banks. So CBDC's are a

894
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,000
the power of the banks. So CBDC's are a
 

895
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,070
the power of the banks. So CBDC's are a
way for the central banks to have their

896
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,080
way for the central banks to have their
 

897
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,630
way for the central banks to have their
own programmable money and banks have to

898
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:00,640
own programmable money and banks have to
 

899
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,909
own programmable money and banks have to
be very careful here because if

900
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:03,919
be very careful here because if
 

901
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,950
be very careful here because if
corporate CBDC's are allowed to exist

902
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:06,960
corporate CBDC's are allowed to exist
 

903
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,310
corporate CBDC's are allowed to exist
and if they pay an interest or a yield

904
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,320
and if they pay an interest or a yield
 

905
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,430
and if they pay an interest or a yield
that threatens banks deposits, banks

906
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:13,440
that threatens banks deposits, banks
 

907
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,950
that threatens banks deposits, banks
don't want their deposit money leaving

908
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:14,960
don't want their deposit money leaving
 

909
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,950
don't want their deposit money leaving
because their customers are buying

910
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:16,960
because their customers are buying
 

911
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,750
because their customers are buying
corporateissued digital currencies like

912
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:19,760
corporateissued digital currencies like
 

913
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,630
corporateissued digital currencies like
Tesla coin that's going to pay them a 5%

914
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:22,640
Tesla coin that's going to pay them a 5%
 

915
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,870
Tesla coin that's going to pay them a 5%
yearly interest on their savings instead

916
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:24,880
yearly interest on their savings instead
 

917
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,070
yearly interest on their savings instead
of their savings account that's going to

918
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:26,080
of their savings account that's going to
 

919
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,590
of their savings account that's going to
pay them 0.2% interest, right? That's an

920
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:29,600
pay them 0.2% interest, right? That's an
 

921
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,750
pay them 0.2% interest, right? That's an
existential threat to the banking power.

922
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:31,760
existential threat to the banking power.
 

923
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,270
existential threat to the banking power.
So, just remember that the banks want

924
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:33,280
So, just remember that the banks want
 

925
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,669
So, just remember that the banks want
CBDC's and control over what

926
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:35,679
CBDC's and control over what
 

927
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,390
CBDC's and control over what
corporations can and can't do with them.

928
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:38,400
corporations can and can't do with them.
 

929
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,470
corporations can and can't do with them.
But they also have some competition and

930
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:40,480
But they also have some competition and
 

931
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,710
But they also have some competition and
their biggest competitor is the crypto

932
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:42,720
their biggest competitor is the crypto
 

933
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,549
their biggest competitor is the crypto
lobby. Now, the crypto lobby is

934
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:44,559
lobby. Now, the crypto lobby is
 

935
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,549
lobby. Now, the crypto lobby is
challenging the banks and what the

936
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:46,559
challenging the banks and what the
 

937
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,750
challenging the banks and what the
crypto people want is fair competition

938
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:49,760
crypto people want is fair competition
 

939
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,870
crypto people want is fair competition
because in a fair game, crypto wins.

940
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:52,880
because in a fair game, crypto wins.
 

941
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,029
because in a fair game, crypto wins.
Crypto knows that and the banks know

942
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:55,039
Crypto knows that and the banks know
 

943
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,110
Crypto knows that and the banks know
that. And here's the CEO of the biggest

944
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,120
that. And here's the CEO of the biggest
 

945
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,510
that. And here's the CEO of the biggest

more money on their money. Uh banks
 

953
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,590
more money on their money. Uh banks
should have to compete on a level

954
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:05,600
should have to compete on a level
 

955
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,350
should have to compete on a level

feel like the banks are not paying high
 

959
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,549
feel like the banks are not paying high
enough interest rates and stable coin

00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:10,559
enough interest rates and stable coin
 

961
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,150
enough interest rates and stable coin
rewards can offer them more then maybe

962
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:12,160
rewards can offer them more then maybe
 

963
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,270
rewards can offer them more then maybe
the banks should have to pay higher

00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:13,280
the banks should have to pay higher
 

965
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,710
the banks should have to pay higher
interest rates to compete. Right?

966
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:14,720
interest rates to compete. Right?
 

967
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,950
interest rates to compete. Right?
>> So that was Brian Armstrong and he wants

00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:18,480
to make sure that the rules are such
 

971
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,710
to make sure that the rules are such
that the crypto lobby can compete with

972
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:20,720
that the crypto lobby can compete with
 

973
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,190
that the crypto lobby can compete with
the banking lobby. Crypto people want

974
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,200
the banking lobby. Crypto people want
 

975
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,830
the banking lobby. Crypto people want
control over the CBDC's so they could

976
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:25,840
control over the CBDC's so they could
 

977
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,310
control over the CBDC's so they could
pay you a higher interest rate for

978
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:28,320
pay you a higher interest rate for
 

979
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,190
pay you a higher interest rate for
holding your cash with them which

980
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,200
holding your cash with them which
 

981
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,350
holding your cash with them which
ultimately threatens what the bank

982
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:33,360
ultimately threatens what the bank
 

983
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,270
ultimately threatens what the bank
deposits which is the bank's source of

984
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:35,280
deposits which is the bank's source of
 

985
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,830
deposits which is the bank's source of
power. But guess who's got more money,

986
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:37,840
power. But guess who's got more money,
 

987
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,150
power. But guess who's got more money,
more lawyers, and more influence. That

988
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,160
more lawyers, and more influence. That
 

989
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,750
more lawyers, and more influence. That
would be the banks, which is why the

990
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:41,760
would be the banks, which is why the
 

991
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,990
would be the banks, which is why the
crypto lobby is upset right now because

992
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,000
crypto lobby is upset right now because
 

993
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,870
crypto lobby is upset right now because
the legislation is not fair to them cuz

994
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:46,880
the legislation is not fair to them cuz
 

995
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,350
the legislation is not fair to them cuz
obviously it's not designed to be and

996
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:49,360
obviously it's not designed to be and
 

997
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,110
obviously it's not designed to be and
that's how the game is played. So

998
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,120
that's how the game is played. So
 

999
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,029
that's how the game is played. So
anyway, at the very top, we've got the

1000
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:53,039
anyway, at the very top, we've got the
 

1001
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,909
anyway, at the very top, we've got the
asset managers, then the banks, then the

1002
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:55,919
asset managers, then the banks, then the
 

1003
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,909
asset managers, then the banks, then the
crypto powers, which depending on how

1004
00:19:57,909 --> 00:19:57,919
crypto powers, which depending on how
 

1005
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,710
crypto powers, which depending on how
regulation goes in the future, aka who

1006
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:00,720
regulation goes in the future, aka who
 

1007
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,150
regulation goes in the future, aka who
has the bigger wallet for the

1008
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:02,160
has the bigger wallet for the
 

1009
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,789
has the bigger wallet for the
politicians, this might flip and the

1010
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:04,799
politicians, this might flip and the
 

1011
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,110
politicians, this might flip and the
crypto lobby could someday overtake the

1012
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,120
crypto lobby could someday overtake the
 

1013
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,029
crypto lobby could someday overtake the
banks. So that's the financial

1014
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:09,039
banks. So that's the financial
 

1015
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,510
banks. So that's the financial
industrial complex or the FIC structure.

1016
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:11,520
industrial complex or the FIC structure.
 

1017
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,669
industrial complex or the FIC structure.
That's power player number one. Power

1018
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:13,679
That's power player number one. Power
 

1019
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,070
That's power player number one. Power
player number two are the sovereigns.

1020
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,080
player number two are the sovereigns.
 

1021
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,310
player number two are the sovereigns.
Now, what do the sovereigns want? And

1022
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:18,320
Now, what do the sovereigns want? And
 

1023
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,710
Now, what do the sovereigns want? And
what they want is almost the opposite,

1024
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:20,720
what they want is almost the opposite,
 

1025
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,270
what they want is almost the opposite,
right? They care about a seat at this

1026
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:23,280
right? They care about a seat at this
 

1027
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,270
right? They care about a seat at this
table and control of their resources.

1028
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:27,280
table and control of their resources.
 

1029
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,830
table and control of their resources.
Their ideal world is where they control

1030
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:29,840
Their ideal world is where they control
 

1031
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,070
Their ideal world is where they control
their energy, their food, their

1032
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,080
their energy, their food, their
 

1033
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,110
their energy, their food, their
industry, their security, even if that

1034
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,120
industry, their security, even if that
 

1035
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,149
industry, their security, even if that
means slower growth and slower markets,

1036
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:38,159
means slower growth and slower markets,
 

1037
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,350
means slower growth and slower markets,
right? Some countries just want to be

1038
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:39,360
right? Some countries just want to be
 

1039
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,070
right? Some countries just want to be
left alone. Other countries want to

1040
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,080
left alone. Other countries want to
 

1041
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,710
left alone. Other countries want to
consolidate power regionally and absorb

1042
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:44,720
consolidate power regionally and absorb
 

1043
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,789
consolidate power regionally and absorb
their geographic proxies like Russia

1044
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:46,799
their geographic proxies like Russia
 

1045
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,630
their geographic proxies like Russia
wants to do with Ukraine, like China

1046
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:48,640
wants to do with Ukraine, like China
 

1047
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,470
wants to do with Ukraine, like China
with Taiwan, like the US did with

1048
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:50,480
with Taiwan, like the US did with
 

1049
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,149
with Taiwan, like the US did with
Venezuela and Greenland and whatever

1050
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:52,159
Venezuela and Greenland and whatever
 

1051
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,149
Venezuela and Greenland and whatever
else, right? And some of these countries

1052
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:54,159
else, right? And some of these countries
 

1053
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,950
else, right? And some of these countries
have expansionary dreams, right? They

1054
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:56,960
have expansionary dreams, right? They
 

1055
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,470
have expansionary dreams, right? They
want to have a seat at the table, which

1056
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:58,480
want to have a seat at the table, which
 

1057
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,990
want to have a seat at the table, which
is why Russia says they're going to join

1058
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,000
is why Russia says they're going to join
 

1059
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,710
is why Russia says they're going to join
Trump's board of peace and they'll pay a

1060
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:02,720
Trump's board of peace and they'll pay a
 

1061
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,190
Trump's board of peace and they'll pay a
billion dollars if they could use the

billion dollars if they could use the
 

1063
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,510
billion dollars if they could use the
money that the US froze from Russia and

money that the US froze from Russia and

money that the US froze from Russia and

1071

>> Okay. Well, then you have the

00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:22,880
>> Okay. Well, then you have the
 

1073
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,110
>> Okay. Well, then you have the
technologists and they don't really care

technologists and they don't really care

technologists and they don't really care
who's in charge politically. What they

who's in charge politically. What they
 

1077
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,549

want are the government contracts, the

data, and maybe a bailout if that's what
 

1081
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,909
data, and maybe a bailout if that's what
keeps them spending. And in return,

00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:35,919
keeps them spending. And in return,
 

1083
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,669
keeps them spending. And in return,
they'll develop all the things like

they'll develop all the things like
 

1085

they'll develop all the things like
digital IDs, the robots, the social

digital IDs, the robots, the social
 

1087
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,230
digital IDs, the robots, the social
credit scores, and and they'll trade the

credit scores, and and they'll trade the

happens to be in power. And then there's

happens to be in power. And then there's
 

1093
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,510
happens to be in power. And then there's
the military-industrial complex. They

1094
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:49,520
the military-industrial complex. They
 

1095
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,510
the military-industrial complex. They
weren't super represented at the World

weren't super represented at the World
 

1097

weren't super represented at the World
Economic Forum, but their interests are

usually instability, which justifies

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,470
usually instability, which justifies

spending, which enriches the defense
 

1103
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,470
spending, which enriches the defense
contractors, which is ultimately a proxy

1104
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:02,480
contractors, which is ultimately a proxy
 

1105
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,590
contractors, which is ultimately a proxy
for the financial industrial complex.

1106
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:05,600
for the financial industrial complex.
 

1107
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,390
for the financial industrial complex.
Now, the good news, though, is this. If

1108
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:08,400
Now, the good news, though, is this. If
 

1109
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,870
Now, the good news, though, is this. If
all goes well, the world should not be

1110
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:10,880
all goes well, the world should not be
 

1111
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,029
all goes well, the world should not be
going to World War II. Instead, we

1112
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:13,039
going to World War II. Instead, we
 

1113
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,430
going to World War II. Instead, we
should hopefully see less invasion and

1114
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:15,440
should hopefully see less invasion and
 

1115
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,230
should hopefully see less invasion and
less occupation because the forever war

1116
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:18,240
less occupation because the forever war
 

1117
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,549
less occupation because the forever war
model is unwinding. So, in a nutshell,

1118
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:22,559
model is unwinding. So, in a nutshell,
 

1119
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,110
model is unwinding. So, in a nutshell,
asset managers want programmable money.

1120
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,120
asset managers want programmable money.
 

1121
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,029
asset managers want programmable money.
The crypto people want to have

1122
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:27,039
The crypto people want to have
 

1123
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,470
The crypto people want to have
competition. The banks want to not be

1124
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:30,480
competition. The banks want to not be
 

1125
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,029
competition. The banks want to not be
irrelevant. Sovereigns want control over

1126
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:33,039
irrelevant. Sovereigns want control over
 

1127
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,390
irrelevant. Sovereigns want control over
their own countries without being

1128
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:34,400
their own countries without being
 

1129
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,070
their own countries without being
destabilized while having a seat at the

1130
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,080
destabilized while having a seat at the
 

1131
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,310
destabilized while having a seat at the
table. Technologists want access to

1132
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:38,320
table. Technologists want access to
 

1133
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,230
table. Technologists want access to
money. And the military is there to just

1134
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:40,240
money. And the military is there to just
 

1135
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,830
money. And the military is there to just
enforce the rules. Now, a lot of what I

1136
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:41,840
enforce the rules. Now, a lot of what I
 

1137
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,909
enforce the rules. Now, a lot of what I
said is overly simplified in this video,

1138
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:43,919
said is overly simplified in this video,
 

1139
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,710
said is overly simplified in this video,
but it is based on provable information.

1140
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:46,720
but it is based on provable information.
 

1141
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,710
but it is based on provable information.
But really, the most important takeaway

1142
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:48,720
But really, the most important takeaway
 

1143
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,789
But really, the most important takeaway
from this video is that I'm not

1144
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:50,799
from this video is that I'm not
 

1145
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,310
from this video is that I'm not
describing altruism versus evil or good

1146
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:54,320
describing altruism versus evil or good
 

1147
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,430
describing altruism versus evil or good
versus bad. This is just power versus

1148
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:57,440
versus bad. This is just power versus
 

1149
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,750
versus bad. This is just power versus
power. And there's a lot that I don't

1150
00:22:59,750 --> 00:22:59,760
power. And there's a lot that I don't
 

1151
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,830
power. And there's a lot that I don't
want to say, not cuz I'm not allowed to,

1152
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:01,840
want to say, not cuz I'm not allowed to,
 

1153
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,110
want to say, not cuz I'm not allowed to,
but because I don't want to sound like a

1154
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,120
but because I don't want to sound like a
 

1155
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,270
but because I don't want to sound like a
conspiracy theorist. But if I could just

1156
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:05,280
conspiracy theorist. But if I could just
 

1157
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,870
conspiracy theorist. But if I could just
give you my personal opinion about all

1158
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:06,880
give you my personal opinion about all
 

1159
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,909
give you my personal opinion about all
of it, I think that all of this has

1160
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:09,919
of it, I think that all of this has
 

1161
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,789
of it, I think that all of this has
already been negotiated. And what we're

1162
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
already been negotiated. And what we're
 

1163
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,510
already been negotiated. And what we're
watching is just political theater. What

1164
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:15,520
watching is just political theater. What
 

1165
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,350
watching is just political theater. What
we're seeing in Venezuela and Greenland

1166
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:17,360
we're seeing in Venezuela and Greenland
 

1167
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,870
we're seeing in Venezuela and Greenland
and Russia, it's just theater to justify

1168
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:20,880
and Russia, it's just theater to justify
 

1169
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,190
and Russia, it's just theater to justify
it all. It's geopolitical posturing for

1170
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:23,200
it all. It's geopolitical posturing for
 

1171
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,669
it all. It's geopolitical posturing for
the countries. They're like, "Okay, in

1172
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:25,679
the countries. They're like, "Okay, in
 

1173
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,470
the countries. They're like, "Okay, in
this new game, how do I want to be

1174
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:28,480
this new game, how do I want to be
 

1175
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,630
this new game, how do I want to be
perceived? Am I weak? Am I strong? Who

1176
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:30,640
perceived? Am I weak? Am I strong? Who
 

1177
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,841
perceived? Am I weak? Am I strong? Who
am I?" Right? What is my identity here?

1178
00:23:32,841 --> 00:23:32,851
am I?" Right? What is my identity here?
 

1179
00:23:32,851 --> 00:23:34,390
am I?" Right? What is my identity here?
[snorts] That is the theater. And this

1180
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:34,400
[snorts] That is the theater. And this
 

1181
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,950
[snorts] That is the theater. And this
is the algorithms making us engage in

1182
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:36,960
is the algorithms making us engage in
 

1183
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,909
is the algorithms making us engage in
all of it. But the reality is that the

1184
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:39,919
all of it. But the reality is that the
 

1185
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,789
all of it. But the reality is that the
range of possible outcomes for all these

1186
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:42,799
range of possible outcomes for all these
 

1187
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,029
range of possible outcomes for all these
possible futures has already been

1188
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:45,039
possible futures has already been
 

1189
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,350
possible futures has already been
pre-negotiated. Maybe not the exact

1190
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:47,360
pre-negotiated. Maybe not the exact
 

1191
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,230
pre-negotiated. Maybe not the exact
script, but the general big idea, I

1192
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,240
script, but the general big idea, I
 

1193
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,549
script, but the general big idea, I
think, has already been established. But

1194
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:52,559
think, has already been established. But
 

1195
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,149
think, has already been established. But
hey, in the meantime, enjoy the

1196
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:54,159
hey, in the meantime, enjoy the
 

1197
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,390
hey, in the meantime, enjoy the
celebration andor the humiliation of

1198
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:56,400
celebration andor the humiliation of
 

1199
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,630
celebration andor the humiliation of
certain people. I can't prove it, but

1200
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:58,640
certain people. I can't prove it, but
 

1201
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,870
certain people. I can't prove it, but
that's just my theory. Now, I do want to

1202
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:00,880
that's just my theory. Now, I do want to
 

1203
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,390
that's just my theory. Now, I do want to
give credit because some of this

1204
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:02,400
give credit because some of this
 

1205
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,149
give credit because some of this
framework was borrowed from Simon Dixon,

1206
00:24:04,149 --> 00:24:04,159
framework was borrowed from Simon Dixon,
 

1207
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,590
framework was borrowed from Simon Dixon,
who's not only talked about this for

1208
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:05,600
who's not only talked about this for
 

1209
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,350
who's not only talked about this for
years, but has made a lot of videos

1210
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,360
years, but has made a lot of videos
 

1211

years, but has made a lot of videos
about these topics. And if you're
