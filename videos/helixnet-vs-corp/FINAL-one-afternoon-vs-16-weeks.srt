00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Let me show you something we built
yesterday afternoon.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
A full production environment. HTTPS,
OAuth2 login, role-based access control,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
six microservices running 24/7
on a dedicated server.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,600
Cost? Seven euros
and 59 cents a month.

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,000
Now let me show you what a corporation
takes to do the exact same thing.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:38,360
This is the Hetzner Cloud console.
That is the server. 2 CPUs, 8 gigs of RAM,

7
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:50,280
80 gig SSD, 7.59 a month.
Six containers, all healthy.

8
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:58,160
Caddy for HTTPS, PostgreSQL for database,
Keycloak for identity management,

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:06,800
Redis, RabbitMQ,
and the application itself.

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:13,320
This is a real login. Real Keycloak.
Real OAuth2. Real role-based access control

11
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,760
with five different roles.
This is not a demo. This is not a mockup.

12
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:27,480
This is production-grade software
running on a seven euro server.

13
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:37,600
Now here's what a corporation takes
for the same thing. Requirements gathering.

14
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:47,400
Two weeks, four meetings.
We said: Hetzner, let's go.

15
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:54,360
Architecture approval.
Three weeks, review board.

16
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,880
We decided on a chat message.
Server provisioning, one to two weeks,

17
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:08,880
infrastructure ticket.
We clicked the button. 30 seconds.

18
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:16,680
Docker setup, one week, infrastructure backlog.
We ran one curl command.

19
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,680
TLS certificate. Two weeks,
security team request.

20
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,320
We ran one OpenSSL command.
Total time for a corporation:

21
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:32,320
eight to 16 weeks. Total budget:
50,000 to 200,000 euros.

22
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,420
We did it in one afternoon.

23
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,880
The difference is not intelligence.
The difference is not tools.

24
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,880
The difference is decision latency.

25
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:51,800
Corporations spend 90% of their time
asking permission.

26
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:58,640
We spend 90% of our time building.
When something broke yesterday,

27
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:05,800
TLS certificates don't work
on bare IP addresses, by the way,

28
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,640
there was no war room.
No post-mortem scheduled for next Tuesday.

29
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:15,640
We diagnosed it. We fixed it.
And we moved on.

30
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,640
That is not speed.
That is ownership.

31
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:28,400
Swiss SMEs are paying SAP
50 to 200,000 euros a year

32
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,720
for systems that take six months
to change a form field.

33
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,360
That is not a feature.
That is a trap.

34
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,360
HelixNet is built for the company
with 5 to 50 people

35
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,000
that needs real tools without
the enterprise ransom.

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
FastAPI. Keycloak. Docker. Open source.
You own it. No license. No lock-in.

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,920
If you are a Swiss SME owner asking
why your IT costs more than your rent --

38
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,000
Let's talk. Link in the description.
