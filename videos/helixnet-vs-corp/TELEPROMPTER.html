<div class="scene">
  <div class="scene-label">Scene 1 -- Camera -- The Hook (60 seconds)</div>
  <div class="direction">Look straight into the lens. Relaxed. Like you're talking to a friend at a bar.</div>
</div>

<p>Let me show you something
we built yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p>A full production environment.
HTTPS. OAuth2 login.
Role-based access control.
Six microservices.
Running twenty-four seven
on a dedicated server.</p>

<div class="pause">... pause ...</div>

<p>Cost?</p>

<div class="pause">... let it hang ...</div>

<p class="key-line">Seven euros and fifty-nine cents a month.</p>

<div class="pause">... pause ...</div>

<p>Now let me show you
what a corporation takes
to do the exact same thing.</p>

<!-- ============================================================= -->

<div class="scene">
  <div class="scene-label">Scene 2 -- Screen Demo -- The Proof (90 seconds)</div>
  <div class="direction">Cut to screen recording. Show each thing as you narrate over it.</div>
</div>

<p>This is the Hetzner Cloud console.
That is the server.
Two CPUs. Eight gigs of RAM.
Eighty gig SSD.
Seven fifty-nine a month.</p>

<div class="direction">Show terminal: docker ps</div>

<p>Six containers. All healthy.
Caddy for HTTPS.
PostgreSQL for the database.
Keycloak for identity management.
Redis. RabbitMQ.
And the application itself.</p>

<div class="direction">Show browser: open https://46.62.138.218/camper, login as nino / helix_pass</div>

<p>This is a real login.
Real Keycloak. Real OAuth2.
Real role-based access control
with five different roles.</p>

<p>This is not a demo.
This is not a mockup.
This is production-grade software
running on a seven euro server.</p>

<!-- ============================================================= -->

<div class="scene">
  <div class="scene-label">Scene 3 -- Screen Demo -- The Comparison (90 seconds)</div>
  <div class="direction">Show the comparison table as an HTML slide, full screen. Read each row slowly.</div>
</div>

<p>Now here is what a corporation
takes for the same thing.</p>

<div class="pause">... read each one, let each land ...</div>

<p>Requirements gathering.
<span class="emphasis">Two weeks. Four meetings.</span>
We said: Hetzner, let's go.</p>

<p>Architecture approval.
<span class="emphasis">Three weeks. Review board.</span>
We decided in a chat message.</p>

<p>Server provisioning.
<span class="emphasis">One to two weeks. Infrastructure ticket.</span>
We clicked a button.
Thirty seconds.</p>

<p>Docker setup.
<span class="emphasis">One week. Infrastructure backlog.</span>
We ran one curl command.</p>

<p>TLS certificate.
<span class="emphasis">Two weeks. Security team request.</span>
We ran one openssl command.</p>

<div class="pause">... pause ...</div>

<p>Total time for a corporation?
<span class="emphasis">Eight to sixteen weeks.</span></p>

<p>Total budget?
<span class="emphasis">Fifty thousand
to two hundred thousand euros.</span></p>

<div class="pause">... pause ...</div>

<p class="key-line">We did it in one afternoon.</p>

<!-- ============================================================= -->

<div class="scene">
  <div class="scene-label">Scene 4 -- Camera -- The Point (90 seconds)</div>
  <div class="direction">Back on camera. This is the heart of the video. Speak slowly. Mean every word.</div>
</div>

<p>The difference is not intelligence.</p>

<p>The difference is not tools.</p>

<div class="pause">... pause ...</div>

<p class="key-line">The difference is decision latency.</p>

<div class="pause">... let it land ...</div>

<p>Corporations spend ninety percent
of their time asking permission.</p>

<p>We spend ninety percent
of our time building.</p>

<div class="pause">... pause ...</div>

<p>When something broke yesterday --
TLS certificates don't work
on bare IP addresses, by the way --
there was no war room.
No post-mortem scheduled
for next Tuesday.</p>

<p>We diagnosed it.
Fixed it.
Moved on.</p>

<p class="key-line">That is not speed.
That is ownership.</p>

<div class="pause">... pause ...</div>

<p>Swiss SMEs are paying SAP
fifty to two hundred thousand euros a year
for systems that take six months
to change a form field.</p>

<p>That is not a feature.
That is a trap.</p>

<p>HelixNet is built for the company
with five to fifty people
that needs real tools
without the enterprise ransom.</p>

<p>FastAPI. Keycloak. Docker.
Open source.
You own it.
No license. No lock-in.</p>

<!-- ============================================================= -->

<div class="scene">
  <div class="scene-label">Scene 5 -- Camera -- Close (30 seconds)</div>
  <div class="direction">Lean in slightly. Direct to camera. This is the handshake.</div>
</div>

<p>If you are a Swiss SME owner
asking why your IT costs
more than your rent --</p>

<div class="pause">... pause ...</div>

<p class="key-line">Let's talk.</p>

<p>Link in the description.</p>

<div class="pause">... hold eye contact for 3 seconds, then cut ...</div>

<div class="direction">CUT TO: Outro card (HelixNet logo + subscribe)</div>

<!-- ============================================================= -->

<div class="scene">
  <div class="scene-label">END -- Total Runtime Target: 5-7 minutes</div>
</div>

<p style="color: #888; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 40px;">
NOTES FOR ANGEL:<br><br>
- Speak slower than you think you need to<br>
- The pauses are where the power is -- do not rush them<br>
- Look at the LENS, not the screen<br>
- The key lines in red are the ones people will quote -- deliver them clean<br>
- It is OK to restart a scene -- we stitch in post<br>
- Each scene is recorded separately -- take a breath between them<br>
- Wolf hoodie stays on -- it is perfect for this<br>
