We deployed a production UAT environment in one afternoon.
HTTPS. OAuth2 login. Role-based access control. 6 microservices. Running 24/7.
Cost: EUR 7.59 per month.

A corporation takes 8-16 weeks and EUR 50,000 to 200,000 for the same thing.
The difference is not intelligence. It is decision latency.
