We built a production UAT environment yesterday afternoon.

HTTPS. OAuth2 login. Role-based access control. 6 microservices running 24/7 on a dedicated server.

Cost: EUR 7.59 per month.

Here is what a corporation takes for the exact same thing:

Requirements gathering: 2 weeks, 4 meetings
Architecture approval: 3 weeks, review board
Server provisioning: 1-2 weeks, infra ticket
Docker setup: 1 week, infra backlog
TLS certificate: 2 weeks, security team
UAT live: 8-16 weeks total
Budget: EUR 50,000 to 200,000

The difference is not intelligence. It is not tools.

It is decision latency.

Corporations spend 90% of their time asking permission.
We spend 90% of our time building.

When something broke mid-session (TLS/SNI does not work on bare IP addresses, by the way) there was no war room. No post-mortem scheduled for next Tuesday. We diagnosed it, fixed it, and moved on. In the same conversation.

That is not speed. That is ownership.

Swiss SMEs are paying SAP EUR 50,000 to 200,000 per year for systems that take six months to change a form field. That is not a feature. That is a trap.

HelixNet is built for the 5 to 50 person company that needs production-grade tools without the enterprise ransom. FastAPI. Keycloak. Docker. Open source. You own it. No license. No lock-in.

If you are a Swiss SME owner asking why your IT costs more than your rent, let us talk.
