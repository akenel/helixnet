00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Check one two, check one two, beginning take five in three seconds. Let me show you

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
something we built yesterday afternoon, a full production environment, HTTPS, or

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
two log-in, roll-based access control, six microservices running 24-7 on a

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:35,600
dedicated server. Costs, seven euros, and 59 cents a month. Now let me show you

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:44,360
what a corporation takes to do the exact same thing. This is the Harexner Cloud

6
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:56,280
console. That is the server. 2CPUs, 8 gigs of RAM, 80 gig SSD, 759 a month, six

7
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:04,160
containers, all healthy, caddy for HTTPS, Postgres SQL for database, key cloak for

8
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:12,800
identity management, redis, rabbit MQ, and the application itself. This is a real

9
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:19,320
log-in, real key cloak, real OAuth 2, real roll-based access control with five

10
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,760
different roles. This is not a demo. This is not a mockup. This is production

11
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:33,480
grade software running on a seven-year-old server. Now here's what a corporation

12
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:43,600
takes for the same thing. Requiring requirements gathering. Two weeks, four

13
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:53,400
meetings, we said, Harexner, let's go. Architectural approval. Three weeks, review

14
00:01:53,400 --> 00:02:00,360
board. We decided on a chat message. Server provisioning one to two weeks

15
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,880
infrastructure ticket. We clicked the button 30 seconds. Docker set up one week

16
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:14,880
infrastructure backlog. We ran one curl command, TLS certificate. Two weeks

17
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:22,680
security team request. We ran one open SSL command. Total time for a corporation,

18
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:32,320
eight to 16 weeks. Total budget, 50,000 to 200,000 euros. We did it in one

19
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:41,420
afternoon. The difference is not intelligence. The difference is not tools. The

20
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:49,880
difference is decision latency. Corporations spend 90% of their time asking

21
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:57,800
permission. We spend 90% of our time building. When something broke yesterday, TLS

22
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:04,640
certificates don't work on bear IP addresses. By the way, there was no war room,

23
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:11,800
no post mortem scheduled for next Tuesday. We diagnosed it. We fixed it and we

24
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:21,640
moved on. That is not speed. That is ownership. Swiss SMEs are paying SAP 50 to

25
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:28,400
200,000 euros a year for systems that take six months to change a form field.

26
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,720
That is not a feature. That is a trap. Helixnet is built for the company with

27
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:43,360
five to 50 people that needs real tools without the enterprise, ransom, fast

28
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:53,000
happy, key cloak, doctor, open source, unit, no license, no lock-in. If you are

29
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,920
Swiss SME owner, asking why your IT costs more than your rent. Let's talk.

30
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:10,840
Link in the description. That's a take.
