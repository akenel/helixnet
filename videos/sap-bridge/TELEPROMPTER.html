<div class="scene-marker">SCENE 1 -- THE CREDIBILITY (look at camera, calm, confident)</div>

<p>I've been building SAP integrations for twenty years.</p>

<p>ABAP proxies for backend lookups.
RFC calls to pull master data in real time.
IDoc and BDoc pipelines for CRM, logistics, finance.</p>

<p>PI/PO message mappings. XI before that.
EDI cross-border for customs and shipping.</p>

<p>If you've worked in enterprise integration in Europe,
you've probably touched one of the systems I helped build.</p>

<p>Fortune 500. Swiss multinationals. Cross-border supply chains.
I've seen it all.</p>

<div class="pause">... pause, small nod ...</div>

<p>And I want to be clear.
<span class="key-line">I'm not here to trash SAP.</span></p>

<p>SAP works. It solved real problems for real companies.
I built my career on it.</p>

<p>But I'd be lying if I said
the world hasn't changed.</p>

<div class="scene-marker">SCENE 2 -- THE SHIFT (direct to camera, then we cut to comparison card)</div>

<p>Think about where we were in 2005.</p>

<p>Everything was on-premise.
Every integration was a six-month project.
You needed a dedicated team just to move data
from one system to another.</p>

<p>SAP PI was the answer. And it was a good answer.
For that world.</p>

<div class="pause">... pause ...</div>

<p>But that world is disappearing.</p>

<div class="direction">[COMPARISON CARD: "2005 vs 2025"]</div>

<p>Today, you can deploy a full integration platform
in an afternoon.
Cloud-native. Open source. Containerized.
One person. One laptop.</p>

<p>SAP knows this.
That's why they built BTP.
But migration from PI/PO to BTP
is slow, expensive, and most companies I talk to...
<span class="key-line">they're stuck in the middle.</span></p>

<p>Running PI/PO because it works.
Knowing it won't last forever.
Not sure what comes next.</p>

<div class="scene-marker">SCENE 3 -- WHAT I'D BUILD TODAY (webcam + screen demos)</div>

<p>So let me show you what I'd build today.
If I were starting fresh.</p>

<div class="direction">[CUT TO: HelixNet screen demos -- Keycloak, FastAPI, Docker]</div>

<p>This is HelixNet.
It's a production platform I built
using only open source tools.</p>

<p>FastAPI for the backend.
Modern Python. Async. Automatic API documentation.</p>

<div class="direction">[SHOW: FastAPI /docs endpoint]</div>

<p>This right here...
this is what PI/PO message mapping does.
Except it's ten lines of Python
instead of a visual mapper
that takes three days to configure.</p>

<div class="direction">[SHOW: Keycloak admin console]</div>

<p>Keycloak. Enterprise identity management.
OAuth2. OpenID Connect. Role-based access control.</p>

<p><span class="key-line">This is what SAP Access Control charges
hundreds of thousands of euros for.
It's open source. It's free.</span></p>

<div class="direction">[SHOW: docker ps -- 6 containers]</div>

<p>Six microservices.
All containerized.
Deploy anywhere.
Running right now on a dedicated server.</p>

<p><span class="key-line">Cost? Seven euros and fifty-nine cents. Per month.</span></p>

<div class="pause">... let that land ...</div>

<div class="scene-marker">SCENE 4 -- THE BRIDGE (back to webcam, this is the money shot)</div>

<p>Now here's the thing.</p>

<p>I'm not saying tear out SAP tomorrow.
<span class="key-line">That would be reckless.</span>
And I've seen enough reckless migrations
to know how that ends.</p>

<div class="pause">... pause ...</div>

<p>But if you're planning
what comes after PI/PO...
and you should be...
<span class="key-line">you need someone who understands both sides.</span></p>

<p>Someone who can read an IDoc
AND write a REST API.</p>

<p>Someone who knows why your RFC calls work today
AND why they won't scale tomorrow.</p>

<p>Someone who's spent twenty years
inside the SAP world...
and the last six months building
what comes next.</p>

<div class="pause">... pause, look directly at camera ...</div>

<p><span class="key-line">The future is hybrid.</span></p>

<p>SAP alongside open source.
Legacy alongside modern.
And hybrid needs a translator.</p>

<p><span class="key-line">That's what I do.
I'm the bridge.</span></p>

<div class="scene-marker">SCENE 5 -- THE CLOSE (warm, open, not salesy)</div>

<p>If your company is somewhere in that middle ground...
running SAP but wondering what's next...
I'd like to talk.</p>

<p>Not to sell you anything.
Just to show you what's possible.</p>

<p>Twenty years taught me how enterprise works.</p>

<p><span class="key-line">The last six months taught me
how fast it can be.</span></p>

<div class="pause">... small smile, nod ...</div>
