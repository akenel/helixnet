## Title
20 Years of SAP. Here's What I'd Build Today.

---

## Description

I've been building SAP integrations for 20 years. ABAP proxies, RFC calls, IDoc pipelines, PI/PO message mappings, EDI cross-border. Fortune 500. Swiss multinationals. I've seen it all.

I'm not here to trash SAP. It works. I built my career on it. But the world has changed.

In this video I show you what a modern integration platform looks like -- built with open source tools, running on a dedicated server for EUR 7.59 per month. Then I explain why the future isn't rip-and-replace -- it's hybrid. SAP alongside open source. And hybrid needs a translator.

That's what I do. I'm the bridge.
