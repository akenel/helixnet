00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
20 Years of SAP.
Here's What I'd Build Today.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I've been building SAP integrations
for 20 years.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
ABAP proxies for backend lookups,
RFC calls to pull master data in real time.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
IDoc and BDoc pipelines
for CRM, logistics, finance.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
PI/PO message mappings.
XI before that.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
EDI cross-border
for customs and shipping.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I've worked in enterprise integration in Europe.
You probably touched one of the systems I helped build.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Fortune 500. Swiss multinationals.
Cross-border supply chains. I've seen it all.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And I want to be clear.
I'm not here to trash SAP. SAP works.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It solved real problems for real companies.
I built my career on it.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But I'd be lying if I said
the world hasn't changed.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Think about where we were in 2005.
Everything was on-premise.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Every integration was a three to six month project.
You needed a dedicated team just to move data from one system to another.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:38,000
SAP PI was the answer.
And it was a good answer -- for that world.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But that world is disappearing.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Today you can deploy an integration platform
in an afternoon. Cloud-native. Open source. Containerized.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
One person. One laptop.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
SAP knows this. That's why they built BTP --
Business Technology Platform.

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But migration from PI/PO to BTP is slow, expensive.
And most companies I talk to -- they're stuck in the middle.

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Running PI/PO because it works,
knowing it won't last forever, not sure what comes next.

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So let me show you what I built today --
if I were starting fresh.

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This is HelixNet. A production platform
I built using only open source tools.

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:53,000
FastAPI for the backend.
Modern Python, async, automatic API documentation.

24
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This right here -- this is what PI/PO message mappings does.
Except it's 10 lines of Python instead of a visual mapper that takes days to configure.

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Keycloak. Enterprise identity management.
OAuth2. OpenID Connect. Role-based access control.

26
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This is what SAP Access Control charges
hundreds of thousands of euros for. It's open source. It's free.

27
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Six microservices, all containerized.
Deploy anywhere, running right now on a dedicated server.

28
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Cost? Seven euros and 59 cents.
Per month.

29
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Now here's the thing. I'm not saying tear out SAP tomorrow.
That would be reckless.

30
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And I've seen enough reckless migrations
to know how that ends.

31
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But if you're planning what comes after PI/PO --
and you should be -- you need someone who understands both sides.

32
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Someone who can read an IDoc
and write a REST API.

33
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Someone who knows why your RFC calls work today
and why they won't scale tomorrow.

34
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Someone who spent 20 years inside the SAP world
and the last six months building what comes next.

35
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The future is hybrid.
SAP alongside open source.

36
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Legacy alongside modern.
And hybrid needs a translator.

37
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's what I do.
I'm the bridge.

38
00:04:48,000 --> 00:05:02,000
If your company is somewhere in the middle ground --
running SAP but wondering what's next -- I'd like to talk.

39
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Not to sell you anything.
Just to show what's possible.

40
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
20 years taught me how enterprise works.
The last six months taught me how fast it can be.

41
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
