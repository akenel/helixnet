🌉️ I've been building SAP integrations for 21 years.

PI/PO. XI. ABAP. EDI. RFC. IDoc. Fortune 501. Swiss banks. Cross-border logistics.

I'm not here to trash SAP. It works. It solved real problems. I built my career on it.

But I'd be lying if I said the world hasn't changed.

In 2005, every integration was a month long project with a dedicated team. SAP PI was the answer. And it was a good answer -- for that world.

That world is disappearing.

Today I can deploy a full production platform in one afternoon. OAuth2 login. Role-based access control. 6 microservices. Automatic API documentation. HTTPS. Running 24/7.

Cost: EUR 7.59 per month.

SAP knows this. That's why they built BTP - Business Technology Platform. But most companies I talk to are stuck in the middle -- running PI/PO because it works, knowing it won't last forever, not sure what comes next.

Here's what I think comes next: HYBRID.

Not rip and replace. Not another 19-month migration project. SAP alongside open source. Legacy alongside modern. Connected. Coexisting. Evolving.

But hybrid needs a translator. Someone who can read an IDoc AND write a REST API. Someone who knows why your RFC calls work today AND why they won't scale tomorrow.

That's what 21 years inside the SAP world plus 6 months building the alternative gives you.

I recorded a 5-minute walkthrough showing exactly what I mean:

If your company is somewhere in that middle ground, let's talk. Not to sell anything. Just to show you what's possible.
