# Video Concept: "20 Years of SAP. Here's What I'd Build Today."

## Positioning
NOT anti-SAP. Pro-evolution. The message: I speak both languages -- legacy and modern. That makes me the bridge.

## Target Audience
- SAP recruiters and hiring managers (Wipro, Hays, Michael Page)
- Swiss SME CTOs considering SAP alternatives or modernization
- LinkedIn connections in enterprise IT
- Anyone searching "SAP PI/PO migration" or "SAP alternative"

## Core Message
"The future isn't rip and replace. It's hybrid. You need someone who speaks both languages."

## Tone
Calm, confident, experienced. Not angry. Not selling. Just a veteran sharing what he sees.

## Duration
3-4 minutes

### INTRO CARD (4 seconds)
"20 Years of SAP. Here's What I'd Build Today."

### SCENE 1: THE CREDIBILITY (0:04 - 0:40)
Webcam. Direct to camera.
- My background: 20 years in SAP integration
- PI/PO, XI, ABAP, EDI, RFC, IDoc -- I've built it all
- Fortune 500 clients, Swiss enterprises, cross-border integrations
- I'm not here to trash SAP. It works. It solved real problems.

### SCENE 2: THE SHIFT (0:40 - 1:20)
Webcam + text cards.
- But the world has changed
- Show card: "2005 vs 2025" comparison
  - 2005: On-premise, licensed, 6-month projects, dedicated teams
  - 2025: Cloud-native, open source, same-day deployment, one-person teams
- SAP PI/PO was built for a world that's disappearing
- BTP is SAP's answer, but migration is slow and expensive
- Most companies I talk to are stuck in the middle

### SCENE 3: WHAT I'D BUILD TODAY (1:20 - 2:30)
Webcam + screen demos of HelixNet.
- Show the live system (Hetzner UAT or local)
- FastAPI: modern Python, async, automatic API docs
- Keycloak: enterprise OAuth2/OIDC -- same auth SAP charges millions for
- Docker: everything containerized, deploy anywhere
- Traefik: automatic HTTPS, routing, load balancing
- Show Keycloak admin: realms, clients, roles -- "This is what SAP Access Control does. Open source. Free."
- Show API docs: "This is what PI/PO message mapping does. 10 lines of Python."
- "Cost: EUR 7.59 per month. Running right now."

### SCENE 4: THE BRIDGE (2:30 - 3:20)
Webcam. This is the key message.
- "I'm not saying tear out SAP tomorrow. That's reckless."
- "But if you're planning what comes AFTER PI/PO -- and you should be -- you need someone who understands both sides."
- "Someone who can read an IDoc AND write a REST API."
- "Someone who knows why your RFC calls work AND why they won't scale."
- "That's the bridge. Legacy to modern. SAP to open source. Or SAP alongside open source."
- "The future is hybrid. And hybrid needs a translator."

### SCENE 5: THE CLOSE (3:20 - 3:50)
Webcam.
- "If your company is somewhere in that middle ground -- running SAP but wondering what's next -- I'd like to talk."
- "Not to sell you anything. Just to show you what's possible."
- "20 years taught me how enterprise works. The last 6 months taught me how fast it can be."
- "The link is below."
