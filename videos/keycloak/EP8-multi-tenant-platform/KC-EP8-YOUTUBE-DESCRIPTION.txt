Multi-Tenant Platform -- Six Realms, Five Businesses, One Keycloak | HelixNet EP8

Six realms. Twenty-six users across five businesses. Cannabis wholesale, headshops, POS systems, platform development -- all on one Keycloak instance. All completely isolated.

This is the series finale. We zoom out from individual flows and roles to see the full multi-tenant architecture. Master realm as control plane, tenant realms as isolated business units, custom branding per realm, and role systems that match each business language.

WHAT YOU'RE SEEING
- Master realm as the control plane (not for end users)
- Each tenant realm registers as a client in master
- 5 business realms with completely independent users, roles, and branding
- HelixPOS: 9 users, 5 custom roles (admin, auditor, cashier, developer, manager)
- HelixNet: 6 users, 4 roles (simpler platform needs)
- 420 Wholesale: 4 users, buyer/seller/network-boss roles (business language)
- Artemis Headshop: 5 users, isolated retail team
- BlowUp V2: Custom branding -- users see BlowUp, not Keycloak
- Architecture scales from 2 users to thousands per tenant
