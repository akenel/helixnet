RBAC Deep Dive -- Role-Based Access Control in Production | HelixNet EP5

Five custom roles. Four real users. One POS realm. This is a deep dive into how role-based access control actually works in Keycloak -- from the principle of least privilege to role accumulation to complete separation of concerns.

This isn't theory. This is a production system with real permission boundaries.
