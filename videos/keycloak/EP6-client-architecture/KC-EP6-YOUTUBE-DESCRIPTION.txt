Client Architecture -- Public vs Confidential OIDC Clients | HelixNet EP6

Three clients. Three OAuth2 patterns. One realm. This episode breaks down how a web app, a native mobile app, and a backend service each connect to Keycloak differently -- and why the distinction between public and confidential clients matters.

If you've ever wondered where client secrets go (and where they don't), this is the episode.
