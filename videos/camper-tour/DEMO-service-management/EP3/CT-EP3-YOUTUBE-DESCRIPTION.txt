Camper & Tour -- Service Management System | EP3: The Full Lifecycle

One job. Three roles. Eight workflow steps. Zero paper.

Episode 3 follows a single repair job from the moment a camper pulls up to the moment the keys are handed back. But here's the twist: we switch users at every stage. Simona at the counter checks in the vehicle. Nino the manager creates the quote and approves the job. Maximo the mechanic logs his work hours. Nino inspects, invoices, and closes. Each role sees exactly what they need -- nothing more.

- Can check in vehicles and register customers
- CANNOT see quotations, invoices, or purchase orders
- CANNOT approve jobs or create invoices
- Clean, focused screen for the reception desk

Nino (Manager):
- Sees everything Simona sees, plus financials
- Creates quotations, approves jobs, generates invoices
- Inspects completed work before closing
- The command center for the shop

Maximo (Mechanic):
- Sees his assigned jobs only
- Logs work hours, adds mechanic notes
- Submits completed work for inspection
- CANNOT approve jobs or touch invoices
- Hands on the vehicle, not the books
