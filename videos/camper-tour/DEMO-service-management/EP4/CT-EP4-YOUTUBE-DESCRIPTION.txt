Camper & Tour -- Service Management System | EP4: The Workshop Floor

One manager. One morning. Five bays. Zero spreadsheets.

Episode 4 follows Nino through a typical morning at the workshop. He logs in, checks the dashboard, then opens the appointments board to manage the day. A walk-in needs help -- assign a bay, fill the quick form, straight into the queue. Then the money shot: the Bay Timeline. A weekly resource grid showing every bay, every job, color-coded and hoverable. This is how you run a shop floor without a whiteboard.

CHAPTERS:
0:00 Intro
0:06 Nino Logs In -- Keycloak SSO
0:18 Manager Dashboard -- Morning Overview

APPOINTMENT SYSTEM:

Two tracks, one board. Booked appointments come in on the left with scheduled times. Walk-ins land on the right with queue positions. Both flow through the same status pipeline.

Status Flow:
- SCHEDULED -- Booked for a time slot, not yet arrived
- WAITING -- Customer showed up, waiting for a bay
- IN_SERVICE -- Vehicle in a bay, work underway
- COMPLETED -- Done, customer notified

Walk-ins skip SCHEDULED and start at WAITING. Urgent jobs get flagged.

BAY TIMELINE:

The resource planning view. Five bays down the left, seven days across the top. Jobs appear as colored bars spanning their duration.

Color Key:
- Blue = Approved (ready to start)
- Amber = In Progress
- Amber + Striped = Waiting for Parts
- Purple = Inspection
- Green = Completed

Hover any bar for job details, customer name, and dates.

BAYS:
1. Bay 1 -- General service
2. Bay 2 -- General service
3. Electrical Bay -- Solar, batteries, 12V/230V systems
4. Bodywork Bay -- Paint, seals, waterproofing
