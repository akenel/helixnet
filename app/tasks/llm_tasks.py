"""
Step 2: Ollama and LLM Task Integration

(Estimated Time: 1-2 days)

Once MinIO is stable, we focus on the worker container:

    Ollama Installation: Update the worker's Dockerfile to install Ollama and define which model (like Llama 3.1 405B, or any other LLM you want to test) should be downloaded on startup.

    LLM Tasks Module: Create a new module, perhaps app/tasks/llm_tasks.py, with a function like generate_content(job_id).

    API Router: Create an LLM-specific endpoint (e.g., /api/v1/llm/generate) that receives the prompt and immediately queues the llm_tasks.generate_content Celery job.

Once Step 2 is done, youâ€™ll be able to send that exact curl command (with a different task name) and get an LLM result back in your storage bucket.
