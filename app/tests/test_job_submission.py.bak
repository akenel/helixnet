# --- CRITICAL FIX: Mocks for the Job Service and DB (These were missing definitions) ---

# 1. Mock Database Model: Mimics the SQLAlchemy model used when creating the job.
# This mock is necessary because the test relies on inspecting the attributes (job_id, status)
# of the object passed to session.add() (see step 6).

@pytest.fixture
def mock_celery_task():
    """Provides a mocked version of the Celery task's delay method."""
    return MagicMock()

# 3. Mock Database Session Factory Fixture (Addresses missing definition of SessionLocal)
@pytest.fixture
def SessionLocal():
    """Provides a mock callable for the SQLAlchemy session factory."""
    # We define a factory that holds a static mock instance. 
    # This allows us to call SessionLocal() in the test and get the same mock 
    # instance every time for assertion checks.
    
    # This is the actual mock session instance that the test will assert against.
    SessionLocal.instance = MagicMock()
