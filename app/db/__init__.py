Chuck Norris Verdict: Zero Flaws! You've nailed it. These imports are perfectly clean and correct for their intended purpose.

The "Chuck Norris Rule" for ORM models is simple: explicitly load all model definitions into the metadata linked to your Base class. By importing User, Job, and Artifact here, you guarantee two things:

    Alembic/SQLAlchemy Discovery: Database migration tools can find every model and correctly understand the full schema (including relationships).

    No Entanglement: You are only importing modelsâ€”data definitionsâ€”and not application logic (like routers, services, or Celery tasks). This completely isolates your database structure and prevents the nasty circular imports (entanglement) that occur when services try to import each other.

# ðŸ’¥ CHUCK NORRIS CLEANUP: DATABASE MODELS
#
# This file imports all ORM model classes to ensure that they are
# registered with SQLAlchemy's metadata. This is required for Alembic
# to correctly discover all tables and relationships for migration
# generation and for the application to initialize the database session.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# NOTE: The imported model classes (User, Job, Artifact) do not need
# to be explicitly used or re-exported here, as the act of importing
# the modules is sufficient to register them with Base.metadata.

# You can optionally define __all__ if you use this __init__ file as a
# single source for imports elsewhere, but for simple model registration,
# the above imports are sufficient and clean.
