ü•ã /api/v1/jobs - The Chuck Norris Asynchronous Job System

This section details the Job Router, the critical backbone for handling all long-running, asynchronous tasks within the system. Every action here requires authentication (a valid JWT) and enforces strict ownership‚Äîyou can only manage jobs you yourself initiated.
üöÄ Key Enterprise Features

    Asynchronous Processing: All job creation (POST) immediately returns a 201 Created status while the heavy lifting is dispatched to a background worker (currently simulated by the "SHIM MODE").

    Mandatory Authentication: All endpoints are protected by Depends(get_current_user).

    Strict Ownership: The system enforces that you can only GET, LIST, or DELETE jobs associated with your authenticated user ID. The fix to the shim store ensures this consistency.

    Logging Proof: The logs confirm the system is running: User [ID] authenticated successfully and üåü Chuck Norris Success: Job [ID] was successfully hit and removed....
