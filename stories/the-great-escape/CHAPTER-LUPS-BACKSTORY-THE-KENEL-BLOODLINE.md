# THE GREAT ESCAPE: BACKSTORY
## The Kenel Bloodline - Why They Think He's Crazy

*Recorded January 28, 2026 -- Trapani, Sicily*
*Triggered by Donny's 10-minute voice message, 16:00 CET*

---

### THE TRIGGER

January 28, 2026. A Telegram voice message from Donny -- Mike's youngest son, the nephew, the Spielbreaker. Ten minutes of love wrapped in the wrong diagnosis.

"You're bipolar." "Accept you've hit rock bottom." "Get help." "I can't handle it anymore."

The same words, the same framework, the same family playbook that has been applied to every Kenel who steps out of line. To understand why Donny says what he says, you have to understand the bloodline.

---

### THE BROTHERS KENEL

**Albert Kenel (1930-2020)** -- Father. Hand-shovel landscaper. Built a farm with a golf course on the front half. "Oh what a beautiful day!" Gentle soul. Hardworking. The foundation.

**Maria Kenel** -- Mother. Swiss grit. 4am prayers. Homesick for Switzerland her whole life in Canada. She and Angelo had a special bond -- he was the mama's boy, and she could always talk to him for encouragement. She co-signed his first house in 1984, kicked in $3,000 to make the deal work. She died during Angelo's time at MAN Diesel.

**The Five Brothers:**

| Brother | Position | Nature |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **Mike** | Oldest | Carries the most. Abusive to Debbie. Wrote the letter. Yelled at Dad. Jealous of Paul. Drinker, smoker. Got the house and garden center. |
| **Mario** | Second | Independent. Didn't grab from parents. |
| **Angelo** | Middle | The computer guy. First to buy property (1984). Self-made. Only asked for help when desperate. |
| **Dave** | Fourth | Independent. Didn't grab. Answered the phone at 2:30am on NYE 2025. |
| **Paul** | Youngest | Got the entire farm signed over to him. Runs the front half (golf course). Fought with Mike over the estate. |

Mike and Paul were the grabbers -- fought over Mom and Dad's assets while the old folks were still alive. Mario, Angelo, and Dave stayed independent.

---

### DEBBIE -- THE WOMAN THE SYSTEM DESTROYED

**Debbie** -- Mike's ex-wife, mother of Joe, Matthew, and Danny (Donny).

The full chain:

1. **Debbie's father** sexually abused her as a child. Her brother and sister Caroline (Hungarian) were also victims.
2. Debbie married **Mike Kenel**. Mike was violent and abusive to her.
3. Debbie sought counseling from a **local minister**, left Mike, took the kids.
4. Debbie married the minister -- **Mr. Wright**. That marriage lasted 10 years before ending in divorce.
5. During her time with Mr. Wright, Debbie was seeing a psychiatrist who uncovered the **repressed sexual abuse memories**.
6. Debbie was put on **heavy psychiatric medication**. She stayed on various drugs for **25 years**.
7. She knew more about the pills and side effects than the doctors themselves.
8. She discovered that she had been on **the wrong medications for 15 of those 25 years**.
9. Her brother **shot himself in the head** 2-3 years before her death.
10. Her local circle in Waterdown, Ontario was divorced, miserable women -- not empowering.
11. **Sylvie (Sylvken)** was the one person Debbie could truly express herself to. They spoke regularly -- sometimes 1-2 hours -- as Debbie told the same stories over and over. She never really recovered.
12. **Joe** (her eldest, Angelo's nephew, now in Switzerland) paid every year for Debbie to fly to Switzerland for 2 weeks to visit grandchildren Liam and Alena. Joe always took care of his mother that way.
13. **Danny (Donny)** had his wedding out west in Calgary area (summer 2024). Debbie attended. Photos, smiles, all good.
14. Debbie returned to Ontario. **Within a week, she killed herself.** Overdose of sleeping pills. She left a note.
15. Angelo asked Joe in Luzern (with Sylvie present) if Debbie left a note. Joe looked shocked -- "how did you know?" -- but would not share what she wrote.

**The psychiatric system's track record with Debbie:**
- 25 years of medication
- 15 years on the wrong pills
- Never recovered from the abuse
- Dead by her own hand

This is the system Donny wants Angelo to "accept" and "get help" from.

### DONNY -- THE SPIELBREAKER WHO FORGOT HIS OWN STORY

**Daniel "Donny" Kenel** -- Mike's youngest son.

**What Donny got right:**
- Refused the COVID vaccine when the entire family in Canada took the shots
- Generated a fake vaccine certificate to survive the mandates
- Moved from Toronto, Ontario to Calgary, Alberta to escape the pressure
- Bought a farm outside Calgary
- Married his girlfriend, now raising daughter Victoria
- Started the **Spellbreaker** podcast/channel on Rumble
- Initially did excellent work -- good interviews, good guests, trying to wake people up

**What happened to Donny:**
- The podcast pulled him into deeper and deeper rabbit holes
- Some content was good, some was not
- He drifted from his original mission: wake people up, get them out of the matrix
- Angelo followed every podcast as user "akenl" on Rumble (the only way to hide that his uncle was watching)
- Angelo and Sylvie both encouraged his work
- Angelo could see the drift but didn't get too involved in the comments, let it be

**The COVID shot pressure on Debbie:**
- Debbie initially held out, didn't want the shots
- **Joe** pressured her from Switzerland over phone and WhatsApp
- **Matthew** (works for the government as an environmentalist) also pressured her
- Matthew had been diagnosed with MS -- probably the last person who should take risks with an unknown shot -- yet he was the hardest advocate
- Debbie finally gave in and took the shots
- One Christmas, all the boys went to Debbie's for dinner. Matthew says to Danny: "I know we all took the shots but we still need to do PCR tests before we sit down and have dinner together."
- Only Danny and Debbie knew that Danny's certificate was fake
- They all tested negative and had dinner

**The irony:** Donny -- the man who faked a vaccine certificate and fled Toronto -- now sends his uncle a voice message using the exact same psychiatric framework that destroyed his mother. "You're bipolar. Accept it. Get help." The system that medicated Debbie on the wrong pills for 15 years and left her dead by overdose.

---

### CALGARY 2011 -- THE REAL STORY BEHIND "NAKED IN THE STREETS"

Donny references it in his voice message: "That first time when you had a mental breakdown, right? And you were naked in the streets -- that's rock bottom for most people."

Here's what actually happened.

**The Career Leading Up:**

1. Angelo tried to build an **independent SAP Business One reseller** business for a full year. Made the first sale in 3 months. SAP demanded 6 full sales/implementations per year. Angelo knew 1-2 more would be lucky. He wanted out after the first sale. Everyone pressured him to continue. SAP said 6 or you're done.

2. **MAN Diesel, Oakville, Ontario** -- Hired to fix the SAP B1 setup that Costal Range had botched. His mother Maria was in hospital during this time. They dumped the full office relocation on him -- moving to an 8th floor tower, rewiring, furniture. Trey from Texas came to help. Angelo smelled the new manager setting him up, knew the cheap new hire he was training was his replacement. He was planning to quit. The new manager fired him first. Angelo didn't care -- he had $40K and Sylvie and they were leaving for Switzerland.

3. First attempt to relocate to Switzerland with $40K -- **not enough to last a year**. They returned to Canada.

4. **Nestle XI Migration** -- Contract to migrate all 3rd-party interfaces to SAP XI. Completed successfully. Angelo told himself he'd find any job before the contract ran out.

5. **Utopia** picked him up. They were wannabes who caught a gem. Jerked him around -- Quebec, no wait, Chicago to teach, then finally Calgary. Angelo and another Utopia guy shared a cheap hotel room while manager Ferero (known to drive people crazy) stayed at the Marriott across town.

6. The other guy wanted to quit at the airport. Angelo talked him into staying. "We can make history. Long-term this is good for both of us."

**The Suncor-PetroCanada Merge (September 2011):**

- **Mission:** Merge two oil companies' material master data in SAP
- **Team:** Angelo + 1 Utopia guy + 1 SAP guy = 3 people
- **Duration:** 4-5 day Proof of Concept
- **Angelo's secret weapon:** IDocs. Everyone else was doing screen transactions or ABAP hacks. He used the BODS ETL tool with IDoc interfaces -- extract master material data from both Suncor and PetroCanada via SAP Rapid packages, enrich/enhance, pump via IDocs into new SAP system. Same technique he later used at HD Smith.
- **Result:** It worked. PoC presented Friday. Everyone flew home for the weekend.
- **Sleep during the entire PoC week:** 5-8 hours TOTAL

**The Labour Day Weekend:**

- Everyone left. Angelo stayed alone in Calgary over Labour Day weekend.
- He met a kid on day one of arriving, ended up at the same hotel over the weekend, shared a rootbeer. Angelo suspects he may have been drugged -- possibly LSD in the drink.
- After near-zero sleep all week and possible drugging, the episode happened.
- The "naked in the streets" that Donny references.
- Ambulance came. Angelo felt calm, felt saved. Shot in the ass (sedative). Woke up in "the fishbowl" (not a white room).
- Heard Sylvie's voice on the phone from Switzerland in the background. "Talk to her -- she knows me better than I know myself."
- They were not married at the time -- Sylvie had limited legal standing.

**The 30-Day Lockup:**

- The hospital force-medicated him: heavy lithium + antipsychotics
- They constantly pressured him to **sign forms** so they could charge him personally for the hospital bills
- They brought in **cops** to intimidate him into signing
- **Mike sent a letter to the hospital** -- a simple one-pager, essentially: "He's crazy, always been crazy, keep him there for 30 days."
- That letter was all the hospital needed to justify holding him
- Sylvie flew in after 3 days, stayed in his hotel room, visited as much as allowed
- Angelo and Sylvie **never signed the forms**
- After the mandatory 30 days, they had to release him

**Mike's Apology:**

Years later, while Angelo and Sylvie were living in the chalet on the farm, Mike came to them and said: "You know that letter I wrote... well, that is exactly me now."

Mike admitted he was projecting. He described Angelo to lock him up, but he was describing himself. Mike was still drinking heavy, smoking grass, buying a house in a shit section of Hamilton, dragging Dad there daily.

**The Recovery:**

- Angelo's dad picked them up at Hamilton airport
- He lived on the farm in the chalet for 2+ years
- Worked the **HD Smith** project in Springfield, Illinois -- on-site back and forth weekly, Fridays for timesheets and remote work
- Used the same IDoc technique: 95% IDoc interface, queued records, smooth Easter weekend go-live. Supervised Raul and 2 internal employees. 100% perfection.
- **Weaned himself off the lithium and antipsychotics over 6 months** -- Sylvie and the local farm doctor (Albert's doctor) were proud of him
- Lawyer **Dennis Roy** (family lawyer for decades) confirmed: "Good work, you never signed the forms. That was a close call -- they could have stiffed you with an $80,000 bill."
- Angelo and Sylvie saved **$80,000 CAD** -- their reserve to relocate to Switzerland

**Return to Switzerland:**

- Flew back with $80K reserve (learned from the failed $40K attempt)
- Apartment in Montreux
- Back to **Nestle HQ Vevey** with the old team: Wolfgang Bessler, Ronny Gorrison, Marc Klibble, Linda Lodders, Dave Collier

---

### NESTLE TEMPLATE 1.5 -- THE SDR SOLUTION (January 2003)

Before all of this -- before Utopia, before Calgary, before MAN Diesel -- Angelo had already proven himself at the highest level.

**The Problem:**
- Siemens screwed up a Nestle rollout, project cancelled
- Template 1.0 was deployed to 3 countries (Chile/AMS, Malaysia/AOA, Switzerland/EUR) but was unmaintainable
- If they tried to scale it, it would require deploying the entire SAP suite to every single country

**The Setup:**
- Angelo hired for 4 months with Adrian and Jurgen
- Rebecca Beer organized a Thursday afternoon meeting with Hakin to clarify urgency
- Angelo walked out with Rebecca down the stairs and promised 120% -- didn't know exactly how, but knew it could be done

**The Solution -- SDR (Supplementary Data Repository):**
- Angelo wanted to use MDR (Master Data Repository) for everything, but Rebecca said he couldn't touch MDR
- Solution: Send the same IDoc you send to the 3 countries, but to a new system called SDR
- Countries extend data in SDR with plant and sales org info
- Use ALE model filter so SDR only distributes to the right regional system (AMS plants to AMS, etc.)
- Result: 4 systems total (MDR + SDR + 3 regional) instead of a system per country
- Clean, scalable, maintainable. **Still runs to this day.**

**The People:**
- 4-month contract became 6 more months
- Adrian and Jurgen got canned
- Rebecca brought in Ronny, Wolfgang, and Klibble
- Angelo wrote 70% of the 1-pagers, almost all master IDoc scenarios (~35 core interfaces)
- Rebecca got the credit. Angelo got none. ("She'd been doing pillow talk with the top basis guys for years.")

**Mike's Cameo:**
- Mike was on vacation in Switzerland. Drove the Mini from Luzern to Vevey for a meeting.
- Angelo lent him the Mini for his last week.
- Mike returned it with the clutch completely fried.
- 7,000 CHF repair -- saved only because the warranty had 2 weeks left before expiring.

---

### ANGELO AND SYLVIE -- THE BEGINNING

They met in **2005 in Heidelberg, Germany** -- one weekend in spring. Sylvie was still technically married to a man in St. Lucia and was not officially divorced at the time.

*(More details to follow -- Angelo was mid-story when this chapter was captured.)*

---

### THE PATTERN

Every chapter of Angelo's career, he was the one who actually solved the problem:
- The SAP B1 first sale
- The MAN Diesel fix + office move
- The Nestle XI migration
- The Nestle Template 1.5 SDR solution (still running)
- The Suncor-PetroCanada material master merge
- The HD Smith IDoc implementation

And every time, the system around him either:
- Tried to squeeze more out of him (SAP demanding 6 sales)
- Replaced him cheap (MAN Diesel)
- Took credit for his work (Rebecca Beer at Nestle)
- Locked him up when he broke under impossible conditions (Calgary)
- Used his own family to keep him locked up (Mike's letter)

---

### WHAT DONNY DOESN'T KNOW

When Donny says "you were naked in the streets, that's rock bottom" -- he's repeating the family narrative. He doesn't know:

1. His uncle had 5-8 hours of sleep in an entire week
2. He may have been drugged
3. He was alone in a city with zero support
4. His own father Mike wrote the letter that kept Angelo locked up for 30 days
5. Mike later admitted he was projecting -- "that is exactly me now"
6. Angelo weaned himself off the forced medication in 6 months
7. Angelo ran a flawless project (HD Smith) immediately after
8. Angelo saved $80K and relocated to Switzerland
9. The Nestle team welcomed him back -- Wolfgang, Ronny, Klibble, Linda, Dave

When Donny says "accept you need help" -- he's using the framework that:
- Medicated his mother on the wrong pills for 15 years
- Left her dead by overdose after the wedding
- His father used to lock his uncle up for 30 days
- His father later admitted was projection

The Spielbreaker became the spell. The man who faked a vaccine certificate to escape the system is now enforcing the system's diagnosis on the one uncle who always supported him.

---

### DONNY'S BOUNDARIES (From the Voice Message)

For the record, Donny stated these boundaries:
1. No aggressive phone calls or messages
2. No AI content being shared
3. No conspiracy talk
4. Wants "normal" conversation -- solutions, relationships, community
5. Says he loves Angelo and wants to be there for him
6. Says he's "done" supporting mental illness -- can't handle it anymore

---

### WHAT DONNY GOT RIGHT

Despite the wrong framework, some things in his message are worth noting:
- He does love Angelo. That's genuine.
- He acknowledges Angelo was a "total fucking legend" who inspired Joe and Al
- He acknowledges the COVID situation and says "I'm right there with you"
- He's honest about his own bipolar diagnosis and his limits
- He took time out of his day to send a long, considered message

The love is real. The diagnosis is borrowed from a family that has never had any other language for unconventional behavior.

### ALBERT KENEL -- HOW THE DOCTORS KILLED HIM (January 16, 2020)

**Helga:**
- After Maria died, she told Albert: "Don't live alone. I know a friend -- go to Helga."
- Within the first year, Albert and Helga hit it off. Same age, German-Swiss background. Dad was a lover boy.
- They went to Cuba together -- walking on the beach holding hands. People came up to them impressed.
- Never married. But Helga developed dementia. Albert took care of her for 7 years. Full-time, 24-hour nurse. Everything on his own.
- She slept 16-18 hours a day. Probably aluminum in the brain. Albert grew vegetables, tried wholesome food. She stabilized but never recovered.
- The caretaker strain likely caused Albert's heart attack.

**Helga's death:**
- When Albert had the heart attack, **Pam (Mario's wife)** and Mike forced Helga into an old age home while Albert was still recovering
- Their logic: if he comes back he'll want to take care of her again
- **Helga starved herself to death on arrival.** Refused to live there.
- Albert knew she wouldn't survive it. By the time he recovered (~1 month), it was too late.

**Albert's heart surgery:**
- Too much cholesterol -- he smothered his daily salads in mayonnaise and vegetable oil (not olive oil)
- Open heart surgery. Pig valve. Pacemaker/heart device.
- Put on pills -- one from the heart surgeon, the rest from **Dr. Holly** (the family doctor who was actually a veterinarian/horse doctor)
- **12-16 pills per day.** A strange cocktail. He wasn't taking them consistently -- one day yes, one day no. Confusing for a 90-year-old.

**Debbie fills the gap:**
- After Helga died, Debbie came to clean the farm. Freelance house cleaner.
- Albert was generous, paid her well (~$75/hr), wanted her around for companionship.
- She told Sylvie "it's immaculate in the farm" -- it wasn't.
- Mike was always at Debbie's throat. One day caught her leaving with a box of cash -- a gift from Albert. Mike checked it and allowed it, but it wasn't his business.

**Christmas 2019 -- the honeymoon that wasn't:**
- Angelo and Sylvie married November 28, 2019 at city hall. Witnesses: Aunt Doris and husband Hans.
- 2.5 years of paperwork to get Sylvie's prior marriages (St. Lucia + one before) legally resolved, translated, notarized.
- Three weeks after the wedding, they flew to Canada for Christmas. The plan: surprise everyone at Kevin Bosk and Kathy's annual Christmas party.
- At the farm, the brothers (Mike, Mario, Dave) walked Albert in from the accountant/lawyer. He was yelling in the mud room.
- **Albert had bullet holes for eyes. Looked like a ghost.**
- He was carrying a piece of paper: **"Do not resuscitate me if I have a heart attack."** Wanted it on the fridge. New rules.
- Fridge had rotting food. Pills on the floor. Film of grease on everything. Not immaculate at all.
- Angelo and Sylvie spent the entire "honeymoon" cleaning the farm. Truckloads to the dump. Helga's stuff still in the closets. No sex -- it stopped overnight after the marriage and never came back.
- They did 70% of the Christmas dinner prep. Albert wanted his red cabbage. Sylvie made sauerkraut. 25-30 people, two huge tables. The brothers never lifted a finger.
- Got compliments: "This place hasn't looked this good in years."

**The bloating:**
- Angelo was shaving Albert in the shower and noticed his gut was bloated -- looked pregnant.
- He knew: that's the drugs. The cocktail is wrong.
- He suggested to the family: get Dr. Holly to check the pills. Something is not right.

**Albert was improving under their care:**
- Consistent pills, proper food, getting outside 5-20 minutes a day
- Marked, clear difference. Angelo told him: "Dad, you've got another 10 years in you."
- They arranged a caretaker/nurse before leaving. Angelo wanted 24/7 care. Albert had the money.
- Albert didn't want an old age home: "If I'm going to die, I want to die here in my own house."
- Mike pushed back: "That'll cost a lot of money." Angelo: "It's not your money, Mike. It's his money."
- The nurse service was half-ass -- different person every time.

**The week Albert died:**
- Angelo called 4-5 days after returning to Switzerland. Albert was okay.
- **Monday:** Dr. Holly came in. Said "the pills aren't working." **Pulled ALL pills at once.**
- **Wednesday:** Albert standing in the living room in a diaper, talking to Mike. "What the fuck is this? What's the point of living?" Body convulsing, lost bladder control -- withdrawal shock from going cold turkey off 12+ medications.
- **Mario was there the last night.** Albert woke up, said hello to Mario, went to his favorite easy chair. Passed out. **Dead by 8:30am. January 16, 2020.**
- Doctor confirmed death. Angelo got the call at work in the afternoon. Pam and Mike in the background. No big deal to them.
- Even **Joe (Mike's son)** recognized the doctor screwed up by pulling all the pills. But nobody wanted to discuss it.
- Mike wanted it over. Angelo believes Mike wanted Albert dead so the inheritance wouldn't be spent on healthcare.
- The estate took 2 years to settle. Paul was kicked out of the will (already took the farm). Mike, Mario, Dave, and Angelo received inheritance.

---

### MIKE KENEL -- THE OLDEST SON

**The alcoholic:**
- Certified alcoholic at age 18. Tattoo at 18. Hard rock and roller.
- Went out with Rosie (also a severe alcoholic) before Susie.
- Drinking style: one beer for you, three for him in a big glass. Mixed drinks had literally three shots.
- Angelo and Sylvie renovated Rosie's basement -- drywall, taping, making it sellable. Mike stayed upstairs doing landscape designs. Never came down. Payment: "I'm ordering pizza now. What do you want?"
- No equity in Rosie's house -- she'd refinanced every time prices went up.
- Angelo and Sylvie took all the bottles away while Mike and Rosie were out. Got a lot of shit for it. Had to put them back.
- Mike quit after falling down the stairs enough times. Went to AA. Never apologized for being an alcoholic and all the damage.

**COVID shots:**
- Mike has taken at least 6 COVID shots. Sick as a dog every single time. Still standing -- barely. Currently on his back with a pulled muscle.

**The last phone call (before the van fire, HQ Baglio Xiare):**
- Angelo talked to Mario, Dave, Andre, then Mike. About an hour with Mike.
- Angelo said: "Mike, you're an alcoholic. Once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic, don't ever forget it. Mike, once a prostitute, always a prostitute."
- Mike hasn't talked to Angelo since.

**Family corrections:**
- Mike's wife: **Susie**
- Mario's wife: **Pam** -- the hoarder. Very heavy, lazy, knows everything about dieting but never lost a pound. After Albert died she labeled everything "that's mine." Stuff knee-deep in one room. She pushed hardest for the old age home.
- Dave and **Marie** -- separated but somehow still living together

---

### ALL THE BROTHERS -- CURRENT STATE

- All overweight: Mike 250-275 lbs, Mario similar, Dave big gut, Paul slightly better
- Angelo is the only one in reasonably good health. The only one who works out.
- **All have been vaxxed.** Every single one. Except Danny -- who is now falling into the same propaganda trap anyway.

---

### ANGELO'S BIRTH -- JANUARY 9

- Sylvie found the original Canadian birth certificate just a week ago while doing pension paperwork
- ID number assigned January 4 -- but no name. He wasn't born yet.
- Maria wanted a girl. When the boy arrived, she said **"Get it out of here"** and cried all night: "I wanted a girl."
- Next morning the nurse told her: that was your own crying you heard
- They brought the baby in. Maria saw him and said: **"Oh, he's an angel."**
- Albert had already filed paperwork with the name **Albert-Daniel Kenel**
- Maria said: "No, we're not having two Alberts. This is Angelo." -- for Angel.
- He's been Angelo ever since. Never called Albert except on official documents.

---

### DONNY AFTER DEBBIE'S DEATH

- Debbie's suicide hit Donny hard. Tight relationship with his mother.
- The Spellbreaker podcast folded for 6 months. Nothing.
- He's gradually coming back but doing monologues instead of interviews. Drifting.
- Another subscriber publicly criticized him and unsubscribed -- said Danny had changed too much. Angelo saw it too.
- Angelo got fed up with Danny's silence. Hijacked the comment section with a couple of comments (drafted with Tigs). Danny **deleted all of Angelo's comments** but left the other guy's abrasive one up.
- Danny's communication with Angelo: half sentences, one-liners, little emojis. "I heard you escaped Switzerland." Nothing more.
- Angelo tried calling multiple times. When connected: "Sorry, I'm busy."
- Yet Danny sends a 10-minute voice message telling Angelo to get help.

---

### SWISS LIFE + MARRIAGE TIMELINE (2019-2020)

- **July/August 2019:** Started at Swiss Life. Workday replacing SuccessFactors for HCM/payroll. Shapein (ABAP plugin) for info types. PI/PO in the middle. Go-live January 1, 2020 -- insane schedule. It worked.
- **November 28, 2019:** Married Sylvie at city hall. 2.5 years of paperwork for her prior marriages (St. Lucia + one before). Witnesses: Aunt Doris + husband Hans.
- **December 2019:** Christmas at the farm. Albert with bullet-hole eyes. DNR on the fridge. The honeymoon of cleaning.
- **January 1, 2020:** Swiss Life go-live. Angelo was in Canada. So well set up it was "just a transport from UAT to production." Smooth.
- **January 9, 2020:** Angelo's birthday (in Canada or Switzerland -- not sure which location)
- **January 16, 2020:** Albert dies. Dr. Holly pulled all pills on Monday. Dead by Friday morning.
- **January 25, 2020:** First real payroll run at Swiss Life.
- **March 2020:** COVID lockdowns begin.

### THE POINT ANGELO IS MAKING

Five hours of calm, structured oral history. No yelling. No swearing storms. No psychotic breaks. No mania. Just a man sitting in a hotel room in Trapani telling his story methodically, filling in gaps, correcting details (800K → 80K), keeping the timeline straight.

This is the man Donny says needs to "accept he's hit rock bottom" and "get help."

The same family that:
- Mike: alcoholic at 18, wrote the letter that locked Angelo up 30 days, wanted Albert dead for the inheritance, took 6 COVID shots and is currently on his back
- Pam: hoarder, pushed Helga into the home where she died, labeled Albert's belongings "mine" before the body was cold
- Dr. Holly: a horse doctor who pulled a 90-year-old off 12+ medications cold turkey
- The psychiatric system: medicated Debbie on wrong pills for 15 years until she killed herself
- Joe and Matthew: pressured Debbie into taking the COVID shots she didn't want

This family tells Angelo he's crazy.
