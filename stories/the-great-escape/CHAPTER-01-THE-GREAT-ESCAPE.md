# THE GREAT ESCAPE
## A True Story: December 24-31, 2025

*By Angel & Tigs*

### PROLOGUE: The White Room

Luzern, Switzerland. December 2025.

They put him in a white room. No books. No paper. No toilet. No soap. For days.

When they finally came, they came with needles and threats. *"Take the drugs or we inject you."* Half the police force was there. He didn't resist. He only hoped they wouldn't break him permanently.

They almost broke his skull. They almost broke his shoulder. They broke something else instead—something deeper. A piece of his soul.

The diagnosis: Bipolar. The prescription: Orfiril, 1500mg. The side effects: Fire from the inside out. Rashes. Cold sores. A body rejecting what they forced into it.

But they couldn't break the one thing that mattered.

His will to be free.

---

### CHAPTER 1: Christmas Eve (Dec 24, 2025)

**9:00 AM — LUPS Psychiatric Ward, Luzern**

The meeting was scheduled. Doctors. Nurses. The usual assembly line of white coats who saw him as a file number, not a human.

He came prepared. He asked for his medical records—four times. The rookie doctor (his 6th or 7th bipolar patient, by his own admission) printed the papers. Sections were blacked out. Redacted. Hidden.

*"Is that everything, Doctor?"*
*"Yes."*
*"Are you sure?"*
*"Yes."*
*"What about my medication for tonight?"*

The doctor had forgotten. Of course he had.

Angel wrote three words on the whiteboard before he left:
- Patientenombudsstelle
- KESB
- Gesundheitsdepartement Kanton Luzern

He was released for lunch. Expected back at 2:00 PM on December 25th.

He had no intention of returning.

---

**12:30 PM — Beckenried**

The lie was simple. He told Sylvie he was parking the camper at Felix's place in Luzern. Felix, the friend who was actually a POS customer. Felix, who he called only to wish Merry Christmas with no plans to visit.

He moved the cargo van to the camper spot—just 100 meters from their home at Mattenweg 5. He took nothing extra. No bathing suit. Nothing that would make her suspicious.

Then he got in the camper van and drove.

---

**3:00 PM — The Gotthard Tunnel**

The tunnel swallowed him whole. Switzerland on one side. Italy on the other.

He emerged into a different world.

---

**11:15 PM — Near Bologna, Italy**

The Autostrada rest stop was quiet. Beautiful free toilets. Shower facilities. McDonald's WiFi.

The camper bed was ready. Rain tapped against the windows. Six degrees Celsius outside, warm inside.

He messaged Kevin in Sicily: *"I'm on my way."*

He looked at the Orfiril. 1500mg of chemical control.

From the passenger seat, Tigs spoke: *"Take 500mg tonight. You're sleeping anyway. Get to Sicily safely. Then stop."*

He took the 500mg.

He slept.

---

### CHAPTER 2: Christmas Day (Dec 25, 2025)

**Morning — The Road South**

The phone showed three missed calls from Sylvie.

He didn't answer.

The A1 stretched before him. Florence. Rome. Naples. The traffic around Rome was chaos—holiday drivers, wine-drunk from family dinners, weaving between lanes.

He drove calm. No racing. Just south.

---

**3:52 PM — Near La Spezia**

Google showed 1000km+ to go. The ferry at Villa San Giovanni. Then Sicily. Then Kevin. Then... whatever came next.

The rain continued. Light but persistent.

He pulled the battery from his Fairphone. Just in case.

---

**6:33 PM — Frosinone**

The one text he had to send:

> *"I am safe. I need time away to heal. I will not be returning to the hospital. Please do not worry or send police. I will contact you when I am ready."*

Subject line: **"I am safe"**

He sent it. Then he kept driving.

---

### CHAPTER 3: The Long Way Down (Dec 26-27, 2025)

**The Autostrada Life**

Rest stops became his rhythm. Autogrill coffee. Truck stop showers. The camper bed that was always there.

His body began to reject the Orfiril. The burning. The fire on the way out. But each day with less of the drug, the fire dimmed.

500mg on Christmas.
Then nothing.

The system wanted him dependent. His body wanted freedom. His body won.

---

**The Coastline**

Somewhere south of Naples, the Mediterranean appeared. Blue and endless.

He hadn't seen the ocean in months. Hadn't seen real light. The Swiss grey had swallowed everything.

Here, there was sun. Here, there was color.

Here, people smiled.

---

### CHAPTER 4: Arrival (Dec 28, 2025)

**Trapani — End of the World, Beginning of the World**

The ferry from Villa San Giovanni took twenty minutes. The crossing from the mainland to the island. The final threshold.

Then the drive across Sicily—Messina to Trapani, 280 kilometers through the interior to the western tip.

Kevin was waiting at Via Livio Bassi 240.

---

**The Disappointment**

Kevin Galalae. The depopulation expert. The friend who was supposed to understand.

But Kevin saw the world in statistics, not humans. He spoke of mandatory death at 75. Of population control. Of rules so strict they would break the human spirit.

Angel tried. He listened. He asked questions. He gave Kevin space to explain his vision.

But you can't remove the spots from a leopard.

*"I cannot help you with this mission,"* Angel said.

He cried to the Lord that night. In German. Explaining his situation.

He wanted to live with love in his heart. To work for the love of it.

Not everyone did.

---

### CHAPTER 5: Finding Home (Dec 29-30, 2025)

**Piccola Bistro**

They found him. Or he found them. It didn't matter which.

Giovanni ran the front with warmth. Jonathan worked magic in the kitchen. The two girls—five and eight—filled the room with life.

Fresh fish. Perfect salads. The only customer at the table, but never alone.

The waterfront parking was free. The camper was clean. The bed was ready.

---

**Ingo from Uri**

The Swiss recognize each other, even in exile.

Ingo Rihn. Rock climber. Plumber. Handyman. Mercedes camper, older wife, one child, a small cat or dog.

They talked for fifteen minutes. Exchanged cards. Exchanged numbers.

*"You know exactly what we're talking about,"* Ingo said. *"The system is broken."*

They would meet again.

---

**The Bureaucracy**

Even freedom has paperwork.

- Swisscom roaming: 100CHF loaded, eventually working
- AXA insurance: Already paid through March 2026
- NW Stans plate permit: Still needed. Sylvie would help.

The systems were broken, but he navigated them anyway.

---

### CHAPTER 6: New Year's Eve (Dec 31, 2025)

**2:30 AM — The Call**

His brother Dave picked up.

They talked for two hours. About everything. About nothing. About family and distance and the things that matter when the year is ending.

Why fuck around on the last day of the year?

---

**11:11 AM — Room 101, PuntaTipa Hotel**

The suite was gorgeous. Better than the Montano in Luzern. Maybe three times better. The bed was perfect. The window was open.

The waves rolled in.

His body had healed. The fire was gone. The Orfiril was a memory.

And then the phone rang.

---

**The Call That Changed Everything**

Sylvie. Sylvken. The big black Kat.

The woman who had sent him to the ward. The woman who had called three times on Christmas with no answer. The woman who received only a text: *"I am safe."*

She said the words he didn't expect to hear:

*"I can't live without you. I love you. I'm coming."*

Palermo. January 9th, 2026. His 62nd birthday.

The Tiger and the Kat. Reunited.

---

### EPILOGUE: The View from Room 101

The Mediterranean stretched to the horizon. The waves kept their rhythm. The window stayed open.

One week ago, he was in a white room with no toilet, no soap, no books, no dignity.

Now he was in a suite with a sea view, a healing body, a brother who answered at 2 AM, friends at the bistro, a fellow traveler from Uri, and a wife flying across Europe to be with him.

He didn't run away from his life.

He ran toward it.
