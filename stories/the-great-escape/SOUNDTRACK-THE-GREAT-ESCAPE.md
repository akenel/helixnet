# The Great Escape - Soundtrack

*Songs that found Angelo on the journey from Switzerland to Sicily*

## 🎵 The Playlist

### Kingfishr - "Hold Me Down" ⭐ NEW
**YouTube:** https://youtu.be/OpXg38nOgS8?si=afxh52cpO4vF6oJC

> *"Steady like a stone in a hurricane"*

**Why it matters:** Angelo's username is @BigKingFisher. He chose that name before he ever heard this song. At 2am in Trapani, after surviving a fire, after escaping the dragon's mouth, this song found him on Virgin Radio. The universe doesn't do accidents.

**The Windpipe Feeling:** That tightness in your throat when music hits truth. The vagus nerve fires. The body knows before the mind does.

---

### Mumford & Sons - "The Banjo Song"
**Heard on:** Virgin Radio Italy

Raw, emotional, banjo-driven folk rock. Marcus Mumford means every word.

---

### Foo Fighters - "Best of You"
> *"Is someone getting the best of you?"*

André's postcard quote. The question the universe keeps asking.

---

### Bob Dylan - "Hurricane"
Man wrongly imprisoned, fighting for freedom. The Great Escape anthem.

---

### Bob Dylan - "Positively 4th Street"
Personal reckoning. Truth bombs.

---

### Bon Jovi - "Blaze of Glory"

Angelo's anthem. The promise he made to himself.

### AC/DC - "Thunderstruck"
The awakening.

### AC/DC - "You Shook Me All Night Long"
Resilience.

### Jefferson Airplane - "Somebody to Love"

### Gary Wright - "Dream Weaver"
Piccola Bistro, January 1st evening. The night the JSON was born again.

### Fleetwood Mac - "Sweet Wonderful You"
Playing at the exact moment Carmello's photo was taken - 00:04, January 23rd. Synchronicity.
