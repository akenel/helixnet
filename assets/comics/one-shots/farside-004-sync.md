## AI PROMPT (Copy-Paste Ready)

```

Large calendar between them showing every hour blocked with "SYNC" meetings, including "SYNC ABOUT THE SYNC" and "PRE-SYNC FOR TOMORROW'S SYNC"

Small child in center holding simple tin can telephone (two cups connected by string), saying "This works better. It's five cents."

Both adults frozen, staring at child

Caption: "The enterprise communication solution cost $2M. The string worked."

Style: Peanuts minimalist, Banksy subversive, absurdist corporate satire
