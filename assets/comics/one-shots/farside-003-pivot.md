## AI PROMPT (Copy-Paste Ready)

```
Single panel comic, Far Side style, simple black line art:

Corporate man in suit with sponsor patches literally spinning like a ballet dancer, one foot raised, arms out, dizziness spirals around head

Papers flying everywhere from the spinning motion

Small child standing calmly with stopwatch, unimpressed expression: "That's your 47th pivot today"

Whiteboard in background with tally marks showing "PIVOTS THIS QUARTER" - many many marks

Caption: "Agile."

Style: Peanuts simplicity, physical comedy, absurdist, minimalist black lines on white
```

---

## VISUAL GAG

The word "PIVOT" means to turn in place.
He's literally turning in place.
No forward movement.
That's the joke.

---

## DRAW NOTES

- **CTO spinning** - ballet pose, ridiculous
- **Papers flying** - chaos from the motion
- **Kid unmoved** - standing still, watching, timing
- **Tally board** - visual evidence of insanity
- **Dizziness spirals** - classic cartoon dizzy effect

---

## COLOR NOTES

| Element | Color |
|---------|-------|
| CTO | Grey suit, SAP patches |
| Papers | White, flying |
| Kid | Primary colors, grounded |
| Spirals | Yellow/stars |
| Whiteboard | White with black marks |

---

## BONUS DETAIL

On the whiteboard, small text:
- "Q1: 47 pivots"
- "Q2: 52 pivots"
- "Q3: 61 pivots"
- "Forward progress: 0"

---

## ALT TEXT
"A corporate man spins like a ballerina, papers flying around him, dizziness spirals above his head. A child with a stopwatch says 'That's your 47th pivot today.' A whiteboard shows dozens of tally marks under 'PIVOTS THIS QUARTER.'"
