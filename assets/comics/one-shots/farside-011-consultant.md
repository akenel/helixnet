## AI PROMPT (Copy-Paste Ready)

```
Single panel comic, Far Side style:

Fancy consultant at whiteboard covered in prestigious firm logos (McKinsey, BCG, Deloitte), presenting slide that says "Have you tried turning it off and on again?" with "$50,000 invoice" visible

Team of workers nodding seriously, taking notes

Small child in corner holding crayon drawing with same advice written on it: "I said that last week"

Nobody looking at the child, everyone focused on expensive consultant

Caption: "The kid said it for free. The consultant charged $50,000. They listened to the consultant."

Style: Peanuts/Far Side, consulting industry satire, simple lines, class commentary
```

## CONSULTANT'S PATCHES (Like NASCAR)

- McKinsey (chest)
- BCG (sleeve)
- Bain (other sleeve)
- Deloitte (back)
- Accenture (tie)
- PwC (cufflinks)

More patches than the CTO = More expensive = More "credible"

## ALT TEXT
"A consultant covered in prestigious firm logos presents 'Have you tried turning it off and on?' for $50,000. Everyone takes notes seriously. A child in the corner holds the same advice on a crayon drawing: 'I said that last week.'"
