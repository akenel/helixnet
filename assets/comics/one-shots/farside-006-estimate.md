## AI PROMPT (Copy-Paste Ready)

```
Single panel comic, Far Side style, simple black line art:

Corporate man with stopwatch and calculator demanding "I need an ESTIMATE! How LONG?!"

Four nervous team members giving random guesses: "Two weeks?" "Three?" "Four?" "Let me check..."

Small child sitting on floor with half-built LEGO blocks, calmly says: "It takes as long as it takes."

Everyone frozen in stunned silence

Caption: "The only honest estimate ever given in corporate history."

Style: Peanuts simplicity, Gary Larson absurdism, contrast between adult panic and child calm, black and white with colored LEGO blocks

## THE TRUTH

```
Every estimate is a lie.
The only honest answer is:
"It takes as long as it takes."
The kid knows.
The kid builds.
The kid doesn't guess.
```

---

## ALT TEXT
"A corporate man demands time estimates from his nervous team. A child on the floor, building with LEGO blocks, calmly states: 'It takes as long as it takes.' Everyone freezes."
