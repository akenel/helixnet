## AI PROMPT (Copy-Paste Ready)

```
Single panel comic, warm Peanuts style:

Woman with music-note-shaped hair dancing joyfully with a mop as dance partner, eyes closed, pure happiness, musical notes floating everywhere

Small child watching with curiosity: "Who's singing?"

Old MP3 player on the floor (no WiFi symbol, no screen showing ads)

Lyrics floating: "How does it feel..."

Warm lighting, movement lines showing dance energy

Caption: "She can't spell Dylan. She doesn't need to."

Style: Peanuts warmth, celebration of simple joy, black lines with warm feeling
```

## THE TRUTH

```
Dylan wrote for the confused.
Pam doesn't need to understand the words.
The music moves her feet.
That's enough.
That's everything.
```

---

## DIALOGUE OPTIONS

Short version:
- KID: "Who's that?"
- PAM: "Bob Something."
- KID: "Is he good?"
- PAM: "I'm dancing, aren't I?"

---

## COLOR NOTES

| Element | Color |
|---------|-------|
| PAM | Bright, alive, moving |
| Music notes | Yellow, gold (warm) |
| Mop | Grey but held lovingly |
| MP3 player | Black, simple, OLD |
| Background | Warm, not sterile |

---

## NO ADS NO ALGORITHM DETAIL

The MP3 player should have:
- No WiFi symbol
- No streaming logo
- Maybe a little crack (loved and used)
- A headphone wire (not bluetooth)

This is freedom.

---

## ALT TEXT
"Pam dances with her mop, hair made of music notes, pure joy. 'How does it feel' lyrics float in air. A child asks 'Who's singing?' An old MP3 player sits on floor. No ads. No algorithm. Just Dylan."
