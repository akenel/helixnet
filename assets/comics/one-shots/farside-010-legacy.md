## AI PROMPT (Copy-Paste Ready)

```
Single panel comic, Far Side style:

Ancient dusty server covered in cobwebs, blinking lights, multiple warning signs: "DO NOT TOUCH", "Last person who touched this quit", "Written by Kevin 2003 - Kevin left"

Three developers standing at safe distance looking at it fearfully like it's a bomb

Small child walking toward it with finger raised, asking "What if we just turn it off?"

Everyone screaming "NOOOO!" in horror

Caption: "Nobody knows what it does. Nobody knows why it's running. Kevin became a yoga instructor."

Style: Peanuts/Far Side, developer horror comedy, simple lines, cult-like fear of legacy code
```

## ALT TEXT
