## AI PROMPT (Copy-Paste Ready)

```
Single panel comic, Far Side style, split screen:

LEFT SIDE labeled "BEFORE": Simple waterfall diagram with steps 1-5, plain sticky notes, people at desks

RIGHT SIDE labeled "AFTER": Exact same diagram but steps renamed "Sprint 1-5", COLORFUL sticky notes, same people at standing desks, otherwise identical

Consultant pointing proudly at the "AFTER" side: "Transformation complete! That'll be $2M"

Small child looking at both sides: "They're... the same picture."

Caption: "The $2M Agile Transformation: Same process. Different sticky note colors."

Style: Peanuts/Far Side, corporate transformation satire, simple before/after comparison, devastating truth
