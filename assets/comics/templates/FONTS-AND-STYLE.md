## THE SANDRA CONNECTION

### Who Is Sandra?
Sandra from Croatia runs a movement. Freedom-focused.
Anti-establishment. "I DO NOT COMPLY" is her signature.

### The Message Received:
```
Sandra Max Friends, [16/12/2025 20:27]
[Images shared]

Sandra Max Friends, [16/12/2025 20:28]
I do not comply!

Sandra Max Friends, [16/12/2025 20:30]
Font is - EDO SZ
```

### Why It Matters:
- EDO SZ = The font of non-compliance
- Used by freedom movements
- Instantly recognizable rebel energy
- Perfect for HelixNet's "no ads, no algorithm" philosophy

### The Helix Connection:
```
SAP KPMG ACN PwC = COMPLIANCE
                   "You MUST use our platform"
                   "You MUST pay the license"
                   "You MUST follow the process"

HELIX = NON-COMPLIANCE (in the freedom sense)
        "We built our own"
        "No monthly ransom"
        "The kids understand it"
        "I DO NOT COMPLY with vendor lock-in"
```

## THE THREE LAWS OF HELIX COMICS

### 1. SIMPLE ENOUGH FOR KIDS
```
If you can't draw it with a crayon,
remove a line.

If you can't read it aloud,
remove a word.

If you can't understand it at 5,
you don't understand it at 50.
```

### 2. TRUE ENOUGH FOR CTOs
```
Every comic is based on a real UAT.
Every bug happened.
Every obvious solution was missed.
Every caption is a lesson learned.
```

### 3. FREE ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE
```
No ads.
No algorithm.
No paywall.
No compliance required.

I DO NOT COMPLY.
```

## BANKSY INFLUENCE

### What We Take From Banksy:
- **Simplicity** - Stencil-clean, minimal lines
- **Irony** - Corporate logos used against themselves
- **Location** - The message appears where it shouldn't
- **Anonymity** - The art speaks, not the artist
- **Accessibility** - A kid can understand, a critic can analyze

### Banksy Moments In Helix Comics:
- CTO's sponsor logos as self-satire
- CHARLIE's third eye seeing through corporate BS
- KID holding balloon of freedom (container floating away)
- "EXIT THROUGH THE GIFT SHOP" but it's a server room
- Toaster as the oppressor, unplugged by truth
