## SCENE 1: THE ALGORITHM WAKES YOU

### THE SETUP
6:00 AM. DAVE's phone alarm goes off. Before his eyes open, his smart home is already making decisions. The coffee maker starts. The blinds adjust to "optimal awakening lumens." His phone displays today's mood: "PRODUCTIVE."

### THE CAPTION
```
"The algorithm knew Dave was awake 3 seconds before Dave did."
```

### AI PROMPT
```
Single panel comic, dark comedy, LEGO blockhead figure style:

Grey bedroom at 6AM. Blockhead man "Dave" in bed, eyes still closed, arm reaching automatically for phone on nightstand.

Smart home display on wall shows: "GOOD MORNING DAVE - Today's mood: PRODUCTIVE - 78%"

Coffee maker in corner with speech bubble: "BREWING OPTIMAL COFFEE"

Everything automated. Dave hasn't even woken up yet but the machines are already running his day.

Caption: "The algorithm knew Dave was awake 3 seconds before Dave did."

Style: Peanuts/Far Side meets Black Mirror. Muted colors. Dystopian mundane.
```

## SCENE 2: THE COMMUTE

### THE SETUP
Train platform. Dozens of blockhead commuters. Every single one staring at their phone. Perfect synchronized zombies. A pigeon walks between them - the only living thing making eye contact with another living thing.

### THE CAPTION
```
"The pigeon was the only one who noticed the sunrise."
```

### AI PROMPT
```
Single panel comic, dark comedy, LEGO blockhead figure style:

Train platform crowded with identical blockhead commuters, ALL staring down at phones. Perfect grid of zombies. No one looking at each other.

One pigeon in the middle of the platform, looking around confused - the only creature making eye contact with the world.

Sign reads: "PLATFORM 7 - DELAYED: YES"

Beautiful sunrise in background that NO ONE is looking at.

Caption: "The pigeon was the only one who noticed the sunrise."

Style: Peanuts/Far Side meets Black Mirror. Commentary on disconnection. Muted except for the ignored sunrise.

## SCENE 3: THE STANDUP

### THE SETUP
Daily standup meeting. 9:03 AM. Everyone stands in a circle. The meeting was supposed to be 15 minutes. It's been 47 minutes. Someone is sharing their screen showing a spreadsheet about spreadsheets.

## SCENE 4: THE METRICS

### THE SETUP
Performance review. Dave sits across from HR. But HR isn't talking. The AI on the screen is delivering the review. Dave's humanity has been reduced to a decimal point.

### THE SETUP
12:00 PM exactly. Dave eats at his desk. His app told him what to eat. A perfectly balanced meal replacement shake. Grey. Nutritionally complete. Spiritually empty. On his screen: a video titled "10X YOUR PRODUCTIVITY WHILE EATING."

Single panel comic, dark comedy, LEGO blockhead figure style:

## SCENE 6: THE SCROLL

### THE SETUP
11:47 PM. Dave in bed. Phone glowing. The same position he woke up in. The scroll never ends. His screen time: 9 hours 23 minutes. His actual living: unknown. Tomorrow the loop repeats.

## END OF ACT 1

**Total Runtime Estimate:** 6 scenes × 8 seconds = ~48 seconds

**The Setup is Complete:**
- Dave is trapped in THE MACHINE
- Every moment optimized, nothing felt
- The audience feels the suffocation
- Ready for THE GLITCH in Act 2
