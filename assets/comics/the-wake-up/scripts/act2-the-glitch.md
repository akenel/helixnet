## SCENE 7: THE OUTAGE

### THE SETUP
9:47 AM. The impossible happens. The WiFi goes down. Every blockhead in the office freezes. They don't know what to do with their hands. Dave looks up from his phone for the first time in months. He sees a window. There's a world outside.

### THE CAPTION
```
"For 47 seconds, Dave saw the sky. He didn't know what to do with it."
```

### AI PROMPT
```
Single panel comic, dark comedy, LEGO blockhead figure style:

Office in chaos. Five blockhead workers frozen in panic, hands in air, not knowing what to do - their screens show "NETWORK ERROR."

But ONE blockhead (Dave) is looking UP and to the side, seeing a WINDOW for the first time. Through window: trees, blue sky, sunshine.

His expression: confused wonder, like seeing something alien.

Small speech bubble from Dave: "Is that... outside?"

Caption: "For 47 seconds, Dave saw the sky. He didn't know what to do with it."

Style: The first crack of color in the grey world. The window is the only warm light in the scene.
```

## SCENE 8: THE CHILD

### THE SETUP
Lunch break. Dave walks past a park (his app said it was 3% faster than his usual route). A kid is drawing with chalk on the sidewalk. No phone. No optimization. Just... creating. The kid looks up and waves at Dave. Dave doesn't know how to respond to unprompted human contact.

### THE CAPTION
```
"A stranger smiled at Dave. He almost called HR."
```

### AI PROMPT
```
Single panel comic, dark comedy, LEGO blockhead figure style:

Sunny sidewalk with park visible. Small child blockhead happily drawing with chalk (sun, flowers, "HI"), looking up and waving at passing adult.

Dave (adult blockhead) frozen mid-walk, completely confused by unprompted friendly human contact. Thought bubble: "Is this... a security threat?"

Chalk drawings are colorful and joyful - contrast with Dave's grey suit.

Caption: "A stranger smiled at Dave. He almost called HR."

Style: Warmth meeting coldness. Kid represents what Dave has forgotten. Color bleeds in from the child's world.
```

## SCENE 9: THE RECOMMENDATION

### THE SETUP
That night, Dave's phone notices the anomaly. He looked at a tree. He made eye contact with a child. The algorithm adjusts. His feed fills with "productivity content" and "optimization tips." The system is trying to pull him back.

### AI PROMPT
```
Single panel comic, dark comedy, LEGO blockhead figure style:

Close-up of phone screen with menacing recommendations:
- "Why Looking Outside Is Killing Your Productivity"
- "Children Are Distractions: A CEO's Guide"
- "Nature Is Inefficient: Stay Optimized"
- Red warning: "Your Focus Score dropped 12% today"

Dave's blockhead face visible behind/below phone, looking uncertain for the first time - like something doesn't feel right.

Caption: "The algorithm had noticed Dave noticing things. It did not approve."

Style: The phone as surveillance/control. Dystopian recommendation engine. The algorithm as antagonist.
```

## SCENE 10: THE EMPTY DESK

### THE SETUP
Next morning. The desk next to Dave is empty. Janet is gone. No announcement. No goodbye. HR says she "optimized her journey elsewhere." But Dave saw her yesterday. She was smiling. She had a plant. Now: nothing. Like she never existed.

Single panel comic, dark comedy, LEGO blockhead figure style:

Two office desks side by side. Dave at his desk, staring at the EMPTY desk next to him.

Janet's desk is completely bare - eerily clean. A single dead plant left behind.

HR message on screen: "Janet has optimized her journey elsewhere. Her metrics have been archived. Please do not discuss."

Dave's face showing first signs of real concern/fear.

Caption: "They said Janet left. But Janet didn't even take her plant."

Style: Corporate horror. The emptiness is loud. Something is very wrong.
```

## SCENE 11: THE BATHROOM MIRROR

### THE SETUP
Dave escapes to the bathroom. The only place without cameras (he thinks). He looks in the mirror. Really looks. He doesn't recognize himself. When did his eyes get so grey? When did he stop existing?

### AI PROMPT
```
Single panel comic, dark comedy, LEGO blockhead figure style:

Stark bathroom. Dave blockhead staring at himself in mirror. His reflection looks hollow, grey, barely there.

Thought bubbles floating: "Who is that?" / "When did I disappear?" / "Is this what 7.3 looks like?"

Fluorescent lighting harsh and unflattering. The mirror shows the truth.

Caption: "Dave looked in the mirror and saw his employee ID."

Style: Existential crisis in a corporate bathroom. The loneliest place. Breaking point approaching.
```

---

## SCENE 12: THE NOTE

### THE SETUP
Dave goes back to Janet's desk. Looks closer. Under the keyboard, a small note. Janet left it on purpose. It says one word. An address. And three words that change everything:

### THE CAPTION
```
"Janet wasn't optimized. Janet escaped."
```

### AI PROMPT
```
Single panel comic, dark comedy turning hopeful, LEGO blockhead figure style:

Dave blockhead at Janet's empty desk, looking around nervously, pulling a small handwritten note from under the keyboard.

The note reads: "THE SUNRISE CAFE - 742 Awakening Street - 5:30 AM - THE OTHERS ARE REAL"

First hint of something beyond the machine. Janet left a breadcrumb.

Dave's expression: fear mixed with something new - hope?

Caption: "Janet wasn't optimized. Janet escaped."

Style: Thriller moment. The note is warm paper in cold office. A door opening.
```

## SCENE 13: THE 4AM CHOICE

### THE SETUP
4:47 AM. Dave is awake before the algorithm. His phone shows the route to work. But in his hand, the note. Two paths. Everything he knows, or everything he doesn't. His thumb hovers over the phone.

### THE CAPTION
```
"For the first time in his life, Dave woke up before the algorithm. He had 43 minutes to decide who he was."
```

### AI PROMPT
```
Single panel comic, pivotal moment, LEGO blockhead figure style:

Dark bedroom, pre-dawn. Dave sitting on edge of bed, phone in one hand (showing "Route to Work"), Janet's handwritten note in the other ("THE SUNRISE CAFE - 5:30 AM").

Clock shows 4:47 AM - he's awake BEFORE the algorithm.

Two paths visualized: the grey phone (the machine) vs the warm paper note (the unknown).

His face: the weight of the choice.

Caption: "For the first time in his life, Dave woke up before the algorithm. He had 43 minutes to decide who he was."

Style: The before/after moment. Dawn about to break. Everything hangs in the balance.

## END OF ACT 2

**Total Runtime Estimate:** 7 scenes × 8 seconds = ~56 seconds

**The Confrontation is Complete:**
- The WiFi outage cracked the wall
- The child reminded him of joy
- Janet's disappearance showed the stakes
- The note offered a way out
- Dave must choose: Machine or Sunrise

**Next: ACT 3 - THE SUNRISE**
