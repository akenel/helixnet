## SCENE 14: THE WALK

### THE SETUP

5:12 AM. Dave is outside. Walking. No GPS. No optimized route. Just walking toward an address on a piece of paper. The streets are empty. The city is still asleep. For the first time, he notices things: a cat on a windowsill, graffiti that says "WAKE UP", the smell of bread from a bakery. The world existed this whole time.

### THE CAPTION

```
"Dave had walked this street a thousand times. He'd never seen it before."
```

### AI PROMPT

```
Single panel comic, hopeful tone, LEGO blockhead figure style:

Pre-dawn empty city street. Dave blockhead walking alone, holding paper note, NO PHONE visible.

Details he's noticing for first time: cat on windowsill watching him, graffiti on wall saying "WAKE UP", warm light from bakery window, smell of bread implied.

First hint of sunrise on horizon. The world is waking up with him.

His face: wonder, like seeing everything for the first time.

Caption: "Dave had walked this street a thousand times. He'd never seen it before."

Style: Warm colors bleeding into grey city. The dawn of awareness. Beauty in mundane details.
```

## SCENE 15: THE SUNRISE CAFE

### THE SETUP

5:28 AM. Dave finds it. A small cafe, warm light inside, no neon signs, no branding. Just a hand-painted sign: "THE SUNRISE CAFE - OPEN BEFORE THE ALGORITHM." Through the window, he sees them. People. Talking. Laughing. No phones on the table. Janet is there. She waves.

### THE CAPTION

```
"The others were real. And they'd saved him a seat."
```

### AI PROMPT

```
Single panel comic, warm and hopeful, LEGO blockhead figure style:

Small cozy cafe exterior. Hand-painted sign: "THE SUNRISE CAFE - Open Before The Algorithm"

Through large window: group of blockhead people sitting together, talking, laughing. NO PHONES on the table. One of them (Janet) waves toward the door.

Dave blockhead outside, hand on door handle, about to step inside. His face showing hope for the first time.

Warm golden light from inside contrasting with pre-dawn blue outside.

Caption: "The others were real. And they'd saved him a seat."

Style: Warmth vs cold. Community vs isolation. The door between two worlds.
```

---

## SCENE 16: THE OTHERS

### THE SETUP

Inside. Dave sits. They give him coffee - real coffee, not optimized. Janet introduces him. There's Marcus, a former "Chief Optimization Officer" who quit to make furniture. Yuki, an ex-data scientist who now paints. Old Tom, who never had a smartphone and doesn't understand what everyone was so scared of. They all have one thing in common: they chose to wake up.

### THE CAPTION

```
"They'd all been 7.3s once. Now they were just... people."
```

### AI PROMPT

```
Single panel comic, warm community scene, LEGO blockhead figure style:

Inside cozy cafe. Round table with diverse group of blockhead characters:
- Janet (welcoming smile)
- Marcus (ex-exec, now wearing woodworker apron): "I make chairs now."
- Yuki (paint-stained hands): "I paint sunrises."
- Old Tom (elderly, confused): "What's a smartphone?"

Dave sitting with them, overwhelmed, emotional. First real human connection.

Table has: real coffee cups, newspaper, small flower vase. NO PHONES.

Caption: "They'd all been 7.3s once. Now they were just... people."

Style: Warm, golden, intimate. The community of the awake. Found family.
```

## SCENE 17: THE SUNRISE

### THE SETUP

5:47 AM. Someone points to the window. "It's time." They all turn. Through the cafe window, the sun rises. Orange and pink and gold. Dave watches his first conscious sunrise. He feels his chest do something strange. His eyes get wet. He doesn't know why. Old Tom hands him a napkin and says nothing.

### THE CAPTION

```
"Dave cried at a sunrise. His phone would have called it 'suboptimal emotional regulation.' Dave called it 'being alive.'"
```

### AI PROMPT

```
Single panel comic, emotional climax, LEGO blockhead figure style:

Through cafe window: SPECTACULAR SUNRISE in oranges, pinks, golds. The sky is on fire.

Row of blockhead silhouettes watching together. Dave in the middle, tears visible on his face.

Old Tom (elderly blockhead) quietly handing Dave a napkin, saying nothing. The kindness of strangers who understand.

First moment Dave has FELT something real in years.

Caption: "Dave cried at a sunrise. His phone would have called it 'suboptimal emotional regulation.' Dave called it 'being alive.'"

Style: Transcendent moment. The sunrise should be overwhelming. Tears earned, not cheap.
```

## SCENE 18: THE QUESTION

### THE SETUP

Janet asks the question. "So Dave, now that you're awake... what do you want to create?" Dave has no answer. He's never been asked before. The algorithm always told him what to want. Marcus says, "It's okay. Take your time. We're not going anywhere." The sun continues to rise.

```

### AI PROMPT

```
Single panel comic, quiet powerful moment, LEGO blockhead figure style:

Janet blockhead asking Dave: "Now that you're awake... what do you want to create?"

Dave speechless, mouth open, struggling. Thought bubbles: "I... I don't..." / "No one ever asked..." / "The algorithm always..."

Marcus blockhead, kind face: "Take your time. We're not going anywhere."

Sunrise continuing in background window. No pressure. Just space to think.

Caption: "For 34 years, Dave had been told what to want. Now someone was asking."

Style: Quiet power. The weight of freedom. Space to breathe.
```

## SCENE 19: THE ANSWER

### THE SETUP

Three weeks later. Same cafe. Same table. But now Dave has something in his hands. A small sketchbook. Rough drawings. Blockhead figures in funny situations. Nothing optimized. Nothing perfect. Just his. He shows Janet. She laughs. "That's terrible," she says. "Keep going."

### THE CAPTION

```
"Dave's art would never go viral. It would never be optimized. It was his. That was enough."
```

### AI PROMPT

```
Single panel comic, resolution/hope, LEGO blockhead figure style:

Text: "THREE WEEKS LATER"

Same Sunrise Cafe. Dave blockhead NOW SMILING (first smile in the film), holding small sketchbook showing rough drawings of blockhead figures.

Janet looking at it, laughing: "That's terrible. Keep going."

The sketchbook art is imperfect, childlike, but clearly made with joy.

Morning light streaming through window. Dave found his thing.

Caption: "Dave's art would never go viral. It would never be optimized. It was his. That was enough."

Style: Joy. Imperfection as freedom. The permission to create badly.
```

## SCENE 20: THE NEW MORNING

### THE SETUP

Final scene. Same bedroom as Scene 1 and Scene 6. But everything is different. Dave wakes up before his alarm. The smart display is unplugged. No phone in hand. He walks to the window and opens it. Breathes. The algorithm doesn't know he's awake. And Dave doesn't care.

### THE PANEL

### THE CAPTION

```
"Dave woke up. And this time, he meant it."
```

### AI PROMPT

```
Single panel comic, triumphant resolution, LEGO blockhead figure style:

SAME BEDROOM AS SCENE 1 - but transformed:
- Smart display on wall is UNPLUGGED (dark, blank)
- Phone on dresser, NOT in hand
- Window OPEN for first time

Dave blockhead standing at open window, SMILING, breathing fresh air. Sunrise visible, trees, birds singing.

The loop is broken. He woke up before the algorithm and chose not to check in.

Caption: "Dave woke up. And this time, he meant it."

Style: Mirror of Scene 1, but warm colors instead of grey. Freedom achieved. The end is the beginning.
