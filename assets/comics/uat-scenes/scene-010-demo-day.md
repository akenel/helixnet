## AI PROMPT (Copy-Paste Ready)

```
4-panel comic strip, Peanuts/LEGO minimalist style:

Panel 1: Projector screen showing "SLIDE 1 of 50" with complex corporate diagram and buzzwords, corporate man presenting proudly, audience of 4 people already falling asleep

Panel 2: Screen showing "SLIDE 37 of 50" even more complex diagram, presenter still talking, audience now depicted as skulls/ghosts (souls have left), clock showing 2 hours passed

Panel 3: Small child walks up holding ONE simple drawing with three boxes: "User → Button → Happy!", asks "Can I show them?"

Panel 4: Audience suddenly wide awake and excited pointing at child's drawing "THAT'S what we're building!", presenter looking at his 50 slides then the one drawing, stunned silence

Caption: "50 slides. 2 hours. Zero understanding. 1 drawing. 10 seconds. 100% clarity."

Style: Simple black lines, contrast between corporate complexity and child simplicity, Peanuts/Far Side humor
