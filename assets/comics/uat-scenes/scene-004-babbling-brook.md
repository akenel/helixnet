## AI PROMPT (Copy-Paste Ready)

```
4-panel comic strip, Peanuts/LEGO minimalist style:

Panel 1: Orange tiger with stripes floating peacefully in a brook/stream, wavy water lines, code syntax bubbles floating up, zen peaceful, "babble babble..."

Panel 2: Corporate man in logo-covered suit storms up to water's edge with phone, frantic: "We need to PIVOT the PARADIGM!" Tiger unmoved, still floating

Panel 3: Small child wading into water to join tiger, CTO confused on shore, child says "It means relax, Dad"

Panel 4: Tiger and child floating together peacefully, CTO alone on shore with phone, tiger says "That's the problem"

Caption: "Some answers only come when you stop asking."

Style: Simple black lines, blue water, orange tiger, peaceful vs frantic contrast
```

## THE ZEN

```
The brook babbles because it doesn't try to speak.
The tiger floats because he doesn't try to swim.
The CTO sinks because he won't let go of the phone.
```

---

## ALT TEXT
"A tiger floats peacefully in a brook. A frantic corporate man demands answers from the shore. A child joins the tiger in the water: 'It means relax, Dad.' Final panel: tiger and child float together while the CTO stands alone, still holding his phone."
