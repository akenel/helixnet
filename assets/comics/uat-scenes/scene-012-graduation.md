4-panel comic strip, Peanuts/LEGO heartwarming finale:

Panel 1: Role reversal - small child at whiteboard "Final exam, Dad", corporate man (toast-head) sitting nervously at tiny student desk, other characters watching from sides (tiger in brook, woman with music-note hair, three-eyed character)

Panel 2: Whiteboard shows exam questions: "Where is the button?", "When NOT to deploy?", "How many blocks needed?", "What does the brook teach?"

Panel 3: CTO writing correct answers, child checking with checkmarks, answers visible: "On the toaster", "Never Friday", "Three", "Float and listen"

Panel 4: GRADUATION - Child hands diploma "Certified Toast-Competent", CTO holds PERFECT GOLDEN TOAST with tears of joy, whole cast together celebrating, tiger splashing in brook, music notes floating, third eye glowing happy

Caption: "The kids taught the CTO. The toast is finally golden."

Style: Warm, celebratory, Peanuts emotional finale, simple lines with heart, this is the payoff
