## AI PROMPT (Copy-Paste Ready)

```
4-panel comic strip, Peanuts/LEGO minimalist style:

Panel 1: Whiteboard showing "RETRO #147" with same items written repeatedly: "What went well: Communication" and "What didn't: Communication", corporate man smiling "Great retro!"

Panel 2: Huge stack of papers labeled Retro #147 down to #001, character with three eyes scanning them, third eye glowing: "They're all the same"

Panel 3: Small child at whiteboard with crayon, drawing simple picture of stick figures talking and smiling together, asking "Why don't you just talk to each other?"

Panel 4: Entire room silent, everyone staring at the simple drawing, stunned realization on faces

Caption: "147 retros. Same problems. One kid with a crayon."

Style: Simple black lines, corporate absurdity, child's drawing should be warmly simple, Peanuts/Banksy hybrid
```

## COLOR NOTES

| Element | Color |
|---------|-------|
| Whiteboard | White, boring corporate |
| Stack of papers | Grey, repetitive |
| Kid's drawing | Colorful, warm, ALIVE |
| Final panel | The drawing is the only color |

---

## BONUS DETAIL

The kid's drawing should show:
- Stick figures having coffee
- Speech bubbles with just "?" and "!" (actual conversation)
- A sun (hope)
- No process diagram, no framework, just PEOPLE

---

## ALT TEXT
"A whiteboard shows Retro #147 with the same problems listed as always. A stack of 147 identical retro notes sits nearby. A child draws stick figures having coffee together: 'Why don't you just talk to each other?' The room falls silent."
