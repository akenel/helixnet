Panel 3: Small child with backpack walks in: "Dad, why are you pressing the scary button before the weekend?" Everyone turns to look at the child

Panel 4: Clock shows 5:00 PM, man frozen with hand over button, child tugging his sleeve "Let's go home, Dad", button still waiting

Caption: "Never deploy on Friday. Even the kid knows."
