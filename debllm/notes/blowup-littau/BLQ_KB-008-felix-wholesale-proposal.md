## Felix's Concerns (Valid Business Questions)

> *"It all sounds too good to be true..."*
> — Felix, rubbing his beard

### The Solo Operator Risk

Felix spoke with **Mosey from 420** who warned:

```
MOSEY'S WARNING:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
"Solo operators - the good guys get either too busy, and after
the initial first order which is great, it is never the same.
Sometimes perfect, sometimes we have to wait 2, maybe 6 weeks
before these solo operators can deliver a second order.

Nobody has a HelixNet platform like we have.

Most if not all solo operators can never really scale operations.
It's too much of a hassle for Mosey. He moves a lot of product."
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Felix's Specific Concerns

| Concern | Question |
|---------|----------|
| **Scalability** | Can you handle 100-500 wallets? |
| **Reliability** | What if you get too busy or sick? |
| **Quality** | Will second orders match the first? |
| **Delivery** | Can you guarantee 2-3 day shipping? |
| **Logistics** | Will custom labels slow down sales? |
| **Pressure** | Are large orders too much for just you? |

### Felix's Proposed Alternative
> "Let's just do a bunch of small orders every 2-3 weeks to keep things easy for you?"

## Sylvie's Response

### The Reveal

> *"I just got a new partner today and we are working hand in hand.
> He is a little bit of a nerd and we are going to be teaming up together."*
> — Sylvie, smiling
