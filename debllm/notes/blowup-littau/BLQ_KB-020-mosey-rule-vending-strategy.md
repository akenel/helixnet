## Success Criteria

### The Formula

```
VENDING MACHINE SUCCESS = LOCATION + CALIBRATION + BEST SELLERS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. LOCATION (100m Rule)
   └─ Within 100 meters of train station
   └─ High foot traffic
   └─ Commuters = impulse buyers
   └─ 24/7 potential customers

2. CALIBRATION (Equipment/Site)
   ├─ SAFE:    Secure from vandalism
   ├─ SECURE:  Proper locks, camera coverage
   ├─ POWER:   Reliable electrical connection
   └─ ACCESS:  Easy for restocking

3. BEST SELLERS (Restock Strategy)
   └─ Stock what's HOT today
   └─ Not what was hot last year
   └─ Adapt to market trends

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Potential Locations (Central Switzerland)

```
100M RULE - TARGET STATIONS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LUZERN AREA:
├─ Luzern HB (main station)      ★★★★★ HIGH traffic
├─ Littau station                ★★★☆☆ Near Artemis!

└─ Kriens Mattenhof              ★★☆☆☆

├─ Artemis (Littau) ← HOME BASE

## What Works vs What Doesn't

### Truth Bombs from the Event

```
WHAT WORKS (Good Ideas):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ Train station locations (100m rule)
✓ Vapes as primary product
✓ CBD oils (Pink Punch quality)
✓ Quick restock of best sellers
✓ Proper equipment calibration
✓ Safe & secure installation
✓ 24/7 passive income model

WHAT DOESN'T WORK (Bad Ideas):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✗ Remote locations (no foot traffic)
✗ Stocking yesterday's trends
✗ Poor maintenance/restocking
✗ Unsecured equipment
✗ Unreliable power
✗ Ignoring what's actually selling

NO VALUE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✗ [Items discussed at event - TBD]
