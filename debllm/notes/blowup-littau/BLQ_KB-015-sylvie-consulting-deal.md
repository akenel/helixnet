### The Artist's Reality
> "But some days it's raining, you know?
> And as an artist, I might just go to the gym
> and local cafe, hang out, do my research -
> sourcing wools and hardware,
> see what new ideas are trending.
> So I don't really work regular hours."
>
> — Sylvie

```
SYLVIE'S WORK PATTERN:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PINK ZONE DAYS:            RAINY DAYS:
─────────────────          ────────────────
Pink Punch + nap           Gym
Wake up inspired           Local cafe
4 hours = 5 days work      Research mode
Creative flow              Sourcing materials
Invincible feeling         Trend watching

"I don't work regular hours"

## Sylvie's Initial Proposal

> "It would be better if we maybe approve a budget of,
> say, 500 for this vending boxing project.
> Does that sound fair, Felix?"
>
> — Sylvie

### Initial Terms
```
PROPOSAL v1:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Project:        Vending Machine Box Design
Retainer:       CHF 500
Scope:          Design consultation for Pam & Leandra
Timeline:       TBD
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## Felix's Reaction

*Felix pulls into the parking lot...*
*Turns off the car...*
*Unbuckles his seat belt...*
*Leans back...*
*Pulls his beard...*
*Squints his eyes...*

*Finally, slowly breaks out in a smile...*

> "PERFECT!"
>
> — Felix

### Felix's Timeline Question
> "It's going to take a week or two to have the graphics,
> box templates, and all the special labeling -
> is that realistic, Sylvie?"
>
> — Felix

---

## Sylvie's Counter-Proposal

*Sylvie looks at the lake...*

> "You know Felix, you're right.
> And with all the new stuff coming,
> maybe we budget 4 WEEKS to completion.
> Same retainer for me - 500.
> If I need more time or whatever,
> can we say 50 CHF per hour after?
> Is that fair?"
>
> — Sylvie

---

## The Final Agreement

### The Handshake

*Felix extends his hand...*

> "We got a DEAL!
> Now let's go and talk to Rosie.
> I still got to get to Immensee today!"
>
> — Felix

*They shake hands*
