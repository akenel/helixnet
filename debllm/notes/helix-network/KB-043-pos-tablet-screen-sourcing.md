## The Problem

Felix says NO to expensive Artemis tablets. But Pam needs a proper screen.

**Current State:**
- Artemis has the best screens (expensive)
- Not available in DE yet
- JP version exists (OKI)
- Apple Store IRL has table displays (research opportunity)

---

## Research Tasks

### 1. Apple Store Visit (IRL)
- [ ] Visit Apple Store
- [ ] Document table display setup
- [ ] Take photos (if allowed)
- [ ] Get specs and pricing
- [ ] Ask about business/retail programs

### 2. OKI JP Version Research
- [ ] Find OKI tablet models
- [ ] Compare specs to Artemis
- [ ] Check import options DE ← JP
- [ ] Calculate total cost (device + import + warranty)

### 3. Artemis Timeline
- [ ] When available in DE?
- [ ] Pre-order options?
- [ ] Business discount programs?

### 4. Alternatives Analysis
| Option | Screen Quality | Price | Availability | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|--------------|-------|
| Artemis | ★★★★★ | €€€€ | Not in DE | Best but expensive |
| OKI JP | ★★★★☆ | €€€ | Import | Japanese version |
| Apple Table | ★★★★☆ | €€€€ | IRL research | Need specs |
| iPad Pro | ★★★★☆ | €€€ | Available | POS app needed |
| Android Tab | ★★★☆☆ | €€ | Available | Budget option |
