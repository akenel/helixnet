## The Chuck Norris Test

```
SCENARIO: Chuck Norris does his daily round

Chuck: *approaches case*
       *reaches toward glass*

Staff: "Mr. Norris! Would you like to see something?
        I can open the case for you.
        Coffee while you browse?"

Chuck: *nods approvingly*
       *examines BL Platinum Grinder*
       *decides to purchase*

RESULT: Sale made. Item safe. Everyone happy.
```

## Cost Justification

```
CASE COST:        CHF 1,200

WITHOUT CASE:
├─ 1 BL Grinder stolen = CHF 150
├─ 8 stolen per year = CHF 1,200
└─ BREAK EVEN: 1 year

WITH CASE:
├─ Theft reduced 90%+
├─ Professional appearance
├─ Customer trust ("they care about quality")
├─ Staff peace of mind
└─ ROI: Year 2 onwards = pure savings
