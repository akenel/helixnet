## The Incident

```
WHAT:     1x BL Grinder missing
WHEN:     Day 1 at Artemis

RESPONSE: Bruce says "cheaper one, no worries"

```

---

## Prevention Tiers

### TIER 1: Paper Lighters & Low-Value (< CHF 20)
```
├─ Open display, customer can touch
├─ Monitor visually
├─ Accept some shrinkage
├─ Not worth chasing
└─ "Cost of doing business"
```

### TIER 2: Mid-Value Items (CHF 20-100)
```
├─ Visible but behind counter
├─ "Can I see that one?"
├─ Staff hands it, watches
├─ Return to shelf after viewing
└─ Note: Grinders, nice lighters
```

### TIER 3: BL Signature / Collector (CHF 100+)
```
├─ LOCKED DISPLAY CASE
├─ Sensor system active
├─ Sign: "Ask for help"
├─ Staff unlocks, stays present
├─ Offer coffee while viewing
├─ 1-2 TESTERS outside case
├─ Rest locked
└─ "Would you like to feel this one?"
```

---

## The Display Case Protocol

### Setup (Rafi's Job)
```
1. Unbox case (kit = CHF 1200)
2. Wire sensor system
3. Place BL items inside
4. Keep 1-2 testers outside for "feel the flow"
5. Post signage
6. Test sensor alarm
```

### Daily Operation
```
OPEN:
├─ Rafi/Felix unlocks morning
├─ Count items
├─ Log count in system

CUSTOMER REQUEST:
├─ "I'd like to see the BL grinder"
├─ "Of course! Would you like a coffee?"
├─ Staff unlocks
├─ Hands item to customer
├─ STAYS PRESENT
├─ Customer examines
├─ Returns to case or purchases

CLOSE:
├─ Count items
├─ Log count
├─ Lock case
├─ Arm sensors
```

---

## Known Characters Protocol

### Gessler (Sir Gessler)
```
STATUS: Known, history of incidents
ACTION:
├─ Polite but watchful
├─ Don't leave alone with high-value
├─ If alone in store, one staff shadows
├─ NOT banned (yet) - need proof
└─ Note all visits in log
```

### Burt (Robber-Bear)
```
STATUS: Known scammer
ACTION:
├─ Alert staff when enters
├─ Two-person rule (never alone with him)
├─ Document interactions
└─ "Plays games with people"
```

### Unknown Lurkers
```
SIGNS:
├─ Excessive browsing, no questions
├─ Watching staff, not products
├─ Positioning near exits
├─ Eye contact avoidance OR too much eye contact

ACTION:
├─ "Can I help you find something?"
├─ Friendly engagement
├─ Stay visible
├─ If suspicious: alert other staff
```

---

## Timestamp Review Process

### When to Review
```
├─ Item missing at close count
├─ Customer complaint of wrong item
├─ Staff reports suspicious behavior
├─ After known character visit
```

### How to Review
```
1. Note time range (Pam's transaction log)
2. Pull camera footage
3. Cross-reference who was in store
4. Document findings
5. Report to Felix
6. Felix decides: pursue or write off
```

### Decision Matrix
```
VALUE < CHF 50:  Document, don't pursue
VALUE CHF 50-200: Review, decide case-by-case
VALUE > CHF 200: Full investigation
```

## Frankly's Role

```
THE PARROT PROTOCOL:
├─ Frankly spots "nasty" instantly
├─ Watches the door
├─ Asks 3-5 questions (parrot style)
├─ Whistles alert: "FELIX FELIX FELIX"
├─ Customer never comes back = confirmed
└─ TRUST FRANKLY
```

---

## Live and Learn

```
WHAT WE LEARNED:
├─ Open display = invites loss
├─ BL items need protection
├─ Testers satisfy "touch" need
├─ Known characters need watching
├─ Timestamps exist, use them
├─ Sometimes write it off

WHAT WE BUILT:
├─ Display case protocol
├─ Tier system for items
├─ Known characters list
├─ Review process
└─ Frankly's watching
```
