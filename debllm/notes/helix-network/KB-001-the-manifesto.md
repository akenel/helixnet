## The Truth They Tried to Bury

> "Hemp is of first necessity to the wealth & protection of the country."
> — Thomas Jefferson

### 10,000 Years of Human History

```
TIMELINE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

8000 BCE    First cannabis cultivation (Taiwan)
2737 BCE    Chinese Emperor Shen Nung - medical cannabis
1000 BCE    India - sacred plant, Bhang traditions
500 BCE     Hemp rope on Greek ships
100 CE      Chinese invent hemp paper
1000 CE     Hemp sails power global trade

1631-1800s  Cannabis = LEGAL TENDER in Americas
            You could PAY TAXES with hemp

1763-1767   Virginia: JAILED for NOT growing hemp

1776        Declaration of Independence
            Drafted on HEMP PAPER

1840-1900   Cannabis = #1 prescribed medicine in US
            Eli Lilly, Parke-Davis, Tildens, Squibb

1937        Marijuana Tax Act
            Hemp industry destroyed overnight

2025        HelixNETWORK rises
            The CRACKs rebuild what was stolen

## The $100,000 Challenge

Jack Herer offered $100,000 to anyone who could disprove these claims:

1. Hemp was the world's #1 agricultural crop for thousands of years
2. Hemp can produce virtually any product made from petroleum
3. Hemp was suppressed through conspiracy, not science
4. The prohibition has cost humanity trillions

**The challenge remains unclaimed.**

## The HelixNETWORK Spin

### We Don't Wait for Permission

```
THE OLD WAY:
├── Wait for politicians
├── Beg for legalization
├── Hope corporations allow it
└── Stay in the shadows

THE HELIX WAY:
├── Build the infrastructure NOW
├── Document the knowledge (KBs)
├── Connect the CRACKs (network)
├── Share the JAM (open source)
└── One season at a time
```

## The CRACK Philosophy

### Who Are The CRACKs?

```
CRACK = Cannabis Revolutionary And Community Keeper

NOT:
├── Corporate suits
├── Big pharma profiteers
├── Gatekeepers
└── Permission seekers

YES:
├── Field experts (98% men, real-world tested)
├── Passion burning out their ass
├── Zero tech skills, maximum plant knowledge
├── The ones who KNOW, not just sell
└── The inventors, the tinkerers, the healers
```

### The CRACK Code

1. **Share the JAM** - Knowledge is free, credit is sacred
2. **Attribute the source** - CRACK #1's formula gets credit forever
3. **Test in the field** - Real world > theory
4. **Document everything** - KBs are the legacy
5. **One season at a time** - Limited editions, quality over quantity
6. **Heal, don't exploit** - The plant is a gift
