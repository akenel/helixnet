Some people have dogs.
Some people have cats.
Mike has Snake.

## THE PARROT: FRANKLY

**Owner:** The Manager (Key Maker)
**Name:** Frankly

> "Who am I to judge his choice?
> Some like burgers, some like hot dogs.

---

## THE PHILOSOPHY

```
ACCEPTANCE:
├─ Mike has Snake
├─ Manager has Frankly
├─ Felix has Artemis
├─ Coolie has... questions
└─ Everyone has their thing

NO JUDGMENT:
├─ Burgers or hot dogs
├─ Snake or parrot
├─ POS or leather
└─ To each their own
```

## WHAT'S NEXT FOR SNAKE SKINS?

### BLQ Applied to Leather:
- **Characters:** Mike (craftsman), Sylvie (designer), customers
- **Scenes:** Custom order intake, design approval, crafting, delivery
- **System Gaps:**
  - Custom order tracking?
  - Design collaboration tool?
  - Leather inventory?

### Could Be:
- A separate module in HelixNET
- Or its own thing entirely
- "The biggest thing for the club"

### YAGNI For Now:
- Document the scene
- Know the characters
- Water finds its path

---

## THE MOMENT

```
Felix: "What's that all about?"

Mike: "Personal side project. Could be the biggest
       thing for the club. We've been working on
       it for years. Custom leather."

Sylvie: "Pick some skins for your saddle bag."

*Snake watches from the warm cabinet*

Coolie: *takes it all in*

Felix: *already thinking about the system*
```

## CONNECTIONS

- **Artemis → Snake Skins:** Felix bridges both worlds
- **Coolie:** Witness, learns the ecosystem
- **The Club:** What club? (Future scene...)
- **Manager + Frankly:** The parrot knows things

---

*To each their own. Be water.*
