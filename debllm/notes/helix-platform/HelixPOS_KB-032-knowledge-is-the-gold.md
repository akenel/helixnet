# KB-032: Don't Chase the Money, Chase the Knowledge

**Created**: 2024-11-30 (Watching 50 people queue for the press)
**Author**: Angel (epiphany moment)
**Status**: STRATEGIC - Core insight

## The Scene

50 people in line. Each one waiting 2-3 minutes to test the press. Cash deals being whispered. 2,300 CHF machines. Money everywhere.

**But what are they really paying for?**

---

## Mosey's Offer to Felix

> "Felix, you can have this one. Save me the hassle of hauling back to Bern. Special price since it's used."

**The catch:**

> "You'll need maybe 20 hours of buds burning before you get the hang of it. You need to know exactly how to calibrate. Larry makes it look easy but it's not."

> "Start with your WORST buds, not your best, until you get as good as Larry."

> "Pam will not be selling these like hot cakes. Those interested want to talk to an expert."

---

## The 420 Service Plan

> "We got you covered under the 420 service plan. Larry does the recal work once you sell one. Sort of same thing as you guys got with Marco, your vending machine techie."

## Angel's Epiphany

Watching those 50 people:

> "From POS to large equipment sales, the KBs work. But the service guy thing and costs... this is not POS anymore."

> "I see money here. But how can we make it? Take some with Mosey? Or maybe... don't chase the money. Chase the INFO. The gold."

## What Those 50 People Actually Want

| What they THINK they want | What they ACTUALLY need |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| The 3-ton press | How to USE the 3-ton press |
| 2,300 CHF machine | 20 hours of Larry's knowledge |
| German engineering | Temperature calibration secrets |
| Shiny equipment | "Start with worst buds" wisdom |
| A purchase | A relationship (420 service plan) |

---

## The Knowledge Stack

```
Level 1: The Product
         └── 3-ton press, 2,300 CHF, 40kg

Level 2: The Specs
         └── Temperature settings, pressure ratings
         └── (Already in English manuals, videos)

Level 3: The Expertise (GOLD)
         └── "20 hours before you get the hang of it"
         └── "Start with worst buds, not best"
         └── "Larry makes it look easy but it's not"
         └── Calibration secrets
         └── Troubleshooting experience

Level 4: The Network (PLATINUM)
         └── 420 service plan
         └── Larry on-call
         └── Marco for vending machines
         └── Expert community
```

**Mosey sells Level 1. The money is in Level 3 & 4.**

## The HelixNet Opportunity

Don't build an equipment sales platform. Build a **knowledge capture system**.

```
Every Larry has wisdom.
Every Marco has tricks.
Every Felix has experience.

What if we captured it?

## The Business Model Insight

**Mosey's current model:**
- Sell equipment (2,300 CHF)
- Include service plan (420)
- Larry does the work
- Larry's knowledge stays in Larry's head

**What if:**
- Larry documents his calibration process
- Customers can self-serve basic issues
- Larry handles only complex cases
- Knowledge scales, Larry doesn't have to

**Result:**
- Larry serves more customers
- Customers feel empowered
- Knowledge survives if Larry leaves
- Premium tier for "Larry in person"

---

## The Real Gold

Those 50 people in line?

They're not buying a press. They're buying **confidence**. Confidence that they can make it work. That someone (Larry) will help them. That they're not alone.

**The KBs ARE that confidence, in written form.**

---

## Don't Chase the Money

> "Maybe don't chase the money. Chase the info. The gold."

```
Transaction:  One-time, 2,300 CHF, done
Knowledge:    Infinite, reusable, compounds

Mosey sells machines.
HelixNet captures what Larry knows.

Both can win.
```

## The Parallel Structure

| Equipment | Expert | Knowledge (KB) |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| 3-ton press | Larry | Calibration guide |
| Vending machines | Marco | Troubleshooting |
| Volcano vaporizer | Felix | KB-002 |
| Swiss CBD products | Pam | KB-004 compliance |
| Age verification | Team | KB-010 workflow |

**Every expert has a KB waiting to be written.**

## Key Quote

> "Pam will not be selling these like hot cakes. Those interested want to talk to an expert."

**Translation:** The sale isn't the product. The sale is the expertise.

---

*The queue keeps moving. Press, release, next. 50 people. 50 potential customers. But also: 50 people who will need help calibrating, troubleshooting, learning.*

*Larry can help 50 people in person.*
*A KB can help 5,000.*

---

**Don't chase the money. Chase the gold. The KBs.**
