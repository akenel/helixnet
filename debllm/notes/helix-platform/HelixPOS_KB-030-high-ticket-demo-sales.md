## The 3-Ton Press Economics

| Model | Origin | Price | Weight | Sales/Year |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|------------|
| Premium | Germany | 2,300 CHF | 40 kg | 3-4 units |
| Budget | China | 1,200 CHF | ~35 kg | More volume |

**Mosey's insight**: "Not the same as selling papers and grinders."

---

## Why Demos Matter for High-Ticket

> "Most people want to test and see a machine like this."

### The Demo Process
1. **20 minutes to heat up** - customers wait, builds anticipation
2. **Bring your own buds** - test with real product
3. **See the quality** - 3 tons of pressure, visible results
4. **Feel the build** - German engineering vs Chinese
5. **Ask questions** - complex specs, only in English
6. **Negotiate price** - cash deals, handshakes

### Why Online Doesn't Work
- Can't feel 40kg of steel through a screen
- Can't test your own product
- Can't negotiate in BAR Geld
- Shipping is expensive and risky
- Returns would be a nightmare

## The Drop Ship Model

```
Customer sees demo → Decides to buy → Mosey orders from Germany
                                            ↓
                         Ships direct to customer (drop ship)
                                            ↓
                              No inventory sitting in warehouse
```

**Why this works:**
- No capital tied up in slow-moving inventory
- No warehouse space needed for 40kg beasts
- German supplier handles logistics
- Mosey takes margin without the risk

## The Demo Unit Strategy

> "Better to have one at our main shop for demos."

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  MOSEY'S 5 STORES                               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                 │
│  Store 1 (Main): Has demo press ✓              │
│  Store 2: Refers to main store                  │
│  Store 3: Refers to main store                  │
│  Store 4: Refers to main store                  │
│  Store 5: Refers to main store                  │
│                                                 │
│  + Special demo events like today              │
│                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Only need ONE demo unit for the entire network.

## The Cash (BAR Geld) Factor

> "The guys who buy this like to pay in BAR Geld and make deals."

Why cash for big purchases:
- Privacy (no bank trail)
- Negotiation leverage ("I have cash right now")
- Immediate deal closure
- Swiss tradition for big purchases
- Industry culture

**POS Implication**: Need to handle large cash transactions, proper documentation.

---

## Event-Based Sales

Today's event:
- 50+ people showed up
- Venue almost too small
- Serious buyers in the room
- Demo takes center stage
- 20-minute heat-up = captive audience
- Customers bring their own product to test

> "We book a meeting just for the demo."

This is relationship selling, not transactional selling.

---

## Logistics Reality

> "You would need at least 2 strong men just to move it."

**40kg = 88 lbs**

Challenges:
- Swiss Post is fair, but expensive for heavy items
- Last-mile delivery is tricky
- Customer needs help receiving
- Installation/setup may be needed
- Returns basically impossible

**Solution**: Drop ship from German supplier who handles freight.

## Product Tiers at Mosey's Network

```
TIER 1: Consumables (papers, grinders, lighters)
        → High volume, low margin, self-service
        → Any store, any cashier

TIER 2: Mid-range (vaporizers, CBD products)
        → Medium volume, decent margin
        → Some expertise needed
        → Felix's sweet spot (Volcano, etc.)

TIER 3: High-ticket equipment (presses, extractors)
        → Low volume (3-4/year), high margin
        → Demo required
        → Cash deals, relationship sales
        → Specialist knowledge
        → Drop ship model
```

## HelixNet Implications

For Tier 3 products:
- [ ] Flag as "demo required" in product catalog
- [ ] Link to video tutorials (Mosey mentioned these)
- [ ] Track demo appointments
- [ ] Handle large cash transactions
- [ ] Drop ship order workflow (not from local inventory)
- [ ] Customer follow-up after demo

**Not every product sells the same way.**

## Key Quotes

> "This is not the same as selling papers and grinders."

> "Maybe 3 a year... not too many shops have the room for such a beast."

> "We just drop ship and that is easy."

---

*The press hisses as it reaches temperature. The crowd leans in. Someone pulls out a bag of premium buds.*

*This is theater. This is sales. This is why 50 people showed up on a Saturday.*
