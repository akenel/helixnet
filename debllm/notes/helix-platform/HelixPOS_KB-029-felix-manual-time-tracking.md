# KB-029: Felix's Manual Time Tracking - Why It Works (For Now)

**Created**: 2024-11-30 (Walking into the press demo)
**Author**: Angel (from Felix's explanation)
**Status**: REFERENCE - Small shop approach

## Felix's System

> "I open the door and I am the first one at the shop most of the time, so I track them in person."

### The 5-Minute Block Rule

| Actual Time | Rounded To | Felix Calls It |
|-------------|------------|----------------|
| 16:01 | 16:05 | - |
| 16:16 | 16:20 | "the 420" 😄 |
| 16:22 | 16:25 | - |

**Always round UP.** Felix might lose 4 minutes, but he doesn't hire Hanksters.

## Why It Works at Artemis

```
✅ Small team (Pam, Ralph, Leandra, Michael)
✅ Felix is first one there most days
✅ Camera in shop (theft + oversight)
✅ Family trust culture
✅ "I pay every minute" → accurate logging
✅ Probation period filters bad fits
✅ Personal relationships
```

## The Edge Cases Felix Handles

### Early Arrival + Coffee
> "Sometimes they will come 20 minutes, maybe an hour, and chill, drink coffee, and then start."

**Felix's approach**: Trust them to log start time when they actually START working, not when they walk in.

### Overtime for Cleaning
> "Some days they work overtime to clean and re-sort shelves for 20 or 30 minutes."

**Felix's approach**: They log it, he pays it. Simple.

### The Cash Theft Risk
> "I can see them stealing cash but I have the camera - not only for customers stealing stuff but that exact problem."

**Felix's approach**: Camera is the deterrent. Trust but verify.

## Why POS Login Isn't Enough

Angel suggested: "Clock in = login, clock out = closeout"

Felix's response: "Not so simple."

| Scenario | POS Login/Logout | Reality |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| Arrive early, coffee first | Would miss 20-60 min | Paid for it |
| Stay late to clean shelves | Would miss 20-30 min | Paid for it |
| Quick break outside | Still logged in | Still working |

**The gap**: POS tracks SALES time, not WORK time. Cleaning shelves isn't a transaction.

## The Scaling Problem

> "If I have 10 or more people and 2-3 shops, I would need something automated."

```
1-5 employees:  Manual works. Felix is present.
5-10 employees: Getting harder. Need some automation.
10+ employees:  Can't watch everyone. Need system.
50-60 employees: Mosey's world. Two full-time payroll staff.
```

---

## The Family Trust Factor

> "The Artemis staff would have a pretty hard time faking extra hours. It naturally would not happen."

Why:
- Small team, everyone knows each other
- Felix is there daily
- Camera as psychological deterrent
- Probation period filters early
- Leandra example: "Great attitude, has interests, loves working at Artemis"

---

## Leandra's Probation

> "She is still on probation time and she also has to decide if the job is right for her."

Swiss probation period = mutual evaluation:
- Employer evaluates employee
- Employee evaluates job fit
- Both can exit easily during this time

This natural filter prevents Hanksters from ever getting permanent.

---

## The Hybrid Solution (Future)

For Felix's scale:
1. **Optional clock-in/out buttons** (not mandatory)
2. **POS activity as baseline** (proof of presence)
3. **Manual override for non-sales time** (cleaning, setup)
4. **5-minute block rounding** (honor Felix's system)
5. **Trust the employee input** (like today)

The system augments Felix's approach, doesn't replace it.

## Key Quote

> "I don't hire Hanksters in the first place. Look at Leandra - she is new, great attitude, has interests, loves working at Artemis."

**The best time tracking system is hiring the right people.**
