## The Larry Factor

> "Larry is our in-house tech guy and field agent. That guy I trust. He wears multiple hats."

**Larry's job:**
- Order extra parts (plugs, cables, accessories)
- Manage service and tech work
- Recalibrate machines at customer sites
- Fix light bulbs to industrial LED setups
- Works at all 5 stores
- Trusted - handles high-value equipment

**Larry is not a cashier problem. Larry is an asset management problem.**

---

## The Plug Problem

> "The machines come originally with German plugs. China stuff only has American plugs."

```
Origin          Plug Type       Conversion Needed
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Germany         Type F (EU)     → Type J (Swiss)
China           Type A (US)     → Type J (Swiss)
Switzerland     Type J          ✓ Native
```

**Someone has to:**
- Inventory the adapters/converters
- Swap plugs before delivery
- Or include adapter with sale
- Track which units need conversion

---

## The Container Scale

> "We ship 2-3 containers per month."

**One 40ft container = ~67 cubic meters**

Monthly:
- 2-3 containers arriving
- Customs clearance
- Warehouse receiving
- Inventory check
- Repackaging/plug conversion
- Distribution to stores or drop ship

**This is ERP territory, not POS territory.**

---

## Big Customer: Grow Motion (Solothurn)

> "They buy tons of stuff so we can just drop ship the big stuff direct. If they need something last minute for their operation I can usually squeeze it into one of my containers."

**B2B relationship:**
- Major industrial grower
- Recurring bulk orders
- Direct drop ship from container
- Last-minute favors = relationship value
- Probably has net-30/60 payment terms
- Needs invoicing, not POS receipts

---

## The Manpower Reality

> "Wholesaling and heavy logistics... tracking my orders and paying invoices takes a lot of manpower, my friend."

Mosey's back office:
- 2 full-time payroll staff (50-60 employees)
- 1 tech/parts manager (Larry)
- Order tracking team
- Invoice processing team
- Container logistics coordination
- Customs/import documentation

**This is not a POS problem. This is an ERP/WMS problem.**

## Key Quote

> "Wholesaling and heavy logistics, tracking my orders and paying invoices takes a lot of manpower, my friend. Angel, you want to go big or stay home?"

**Answer**: Stay home. Do one thing well. Help the Felixes of the world. And maybe, just maybe, run the POS at Mosey's 5 retail stores.

*The press hisses. Another satisfied customer holds up golden rosin. The queue keeps moving.*

*Angel thinks: "Know your limits. Felix is the customer. Mosey is the inspiration."*
