## The George Clooney Scenario

> *A well-dressed tourist walks in. His Zippo - a black and brown two-tone collector's edition bought in Luzern a year ago - won't spark. The flint is stuck. He has a train to Zurich in 30 minutes.*

**Pam's Response:**
1. "I can fix that in 2 minutes, sir. Please, have a seat. Coffee?"
2. Diagnose: Stuck flint (common after 1 year of use)
3. Fix: Replace flint (CHF 3.00 for 6-pack, use 1 flint)
4. Upsell: "May I suggest our Service Kit? Everything you need for the next 5 years."
5. Customer registration: "While I fix this, let me set you up in our system for VIP updates."

**Result:** Happy customer, CHF 3-12 sale, new CRACK member, lifetime loyalty

## Common Zippo Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: No Spark / Weak Spark (80% of issues)

**Cause:** Worn or stuck flint
**Symptoms:**
- Wheel spins but no spark
- Feels "gritty" when spinning wheel
- Spark is weak/orange instead of bright

**Solution: Replace Flint (2 minutes)**

```
STEP-BY-STEP FLINT REPLACEMENT:

1. Remove the insert from the case
   └─ Pull straight up from the hinge side

2. Unscrew the flint spring
   └─ Located at bottom of insert
   └─ Turn counter-clockwise with fingernail or coin
   └─ BE CAREFUL: Spring is under tension!

3. Remove old flint
   └─ Turn insert upside down, old flint falls out
   └─ If stuck: tap gently, use toothpick
   └─ NEVER use metal tools (damages brass tube)

4. Insert new flint
   └─ Drop ONE flint into the tube
   └─ Flints are small cylinders (~3mm)

5. Replace spring
   └─ Screw clockwise until snug
   └─ DO NOT over-tighten!

6. Test spark
   └─ Should see bright white/yellow sparks
   └─ If weak: check flint orientation
```

### Problem 2: No Flame / Flame Dies Quickly

**Cause:** Empty or evaporated fuel, clogged wick
**Symptoms:**
- Sparks but no flame
- Flame appears briefly then dies
- Fuel smell but no ignition

**Solution A: Refuel (30 seconds)**

```
STEP-BY-STEP REFUELING:

1. Remove insert from case
2. Lift felt pad at bottom (reveals cotton batting)
3. Saturate cotton with Zippo fluid
   └─ Use ONLY Zippo brand fuel
   └─ Saturate until cotton is damp (not dripping)
4. Wait 30 seconds for wick to absorb
5. Replace felt pad and insert
6. Test: Flame should be strong, blue-yellow
```

**Solution B: Replace Wick (5 minutes - rare)**

If wick is black, charred, or too short:

```
STEP-BY-STEP WICK REPLACEMENT:

1. Remove insert, unscrew flint spring
2. Remove cotton batting (keep organized!)
3. Pull old wick through chimney (needle-nose pliers help)
4. Thread new wick:
   └─ Insert from bottom, pull through chimney
   └─ Leave 3mm above chimney
   └─ Weave through cotton batting
5. Replace cotton and felt pad
6. Refuel and test
```

## Maintenance Tips for Customers

### Daily Zippo Users

> "If you use your Zippo daily:
> - Refuel every 1-2 weeks (fuel evaporates even when not in use)
> - Replace flint every 2-3 months
> - Trim wick when charred (snip blackened part)
> - Store closed when not in use"

### Occasional Zippo Users

> "If you use it occasionally:
> - Refuel before each use (fuel evaporates!)
> - Check flint annually
> - Store with fresh fuel to prevent wick drying"

### Collectors

> "For display Zippos:
> - Empty fuel before long storage (prevents case corrosion)
> - Keep in original box or display case
> - Clean with soft cloth (no chemicals on finish)
> - Unfired Zippos hold collector value"

## Felix's Pro Tips

### Tip 1: The 2-Minute Fix Builds Loyalty

> "A CHF 3 flint replacement might seem small, but that customer remembers you fixed their problem in 2 minutes while they waited. They'll come back for the CHF 500 Volcano."

### Tip 2: Stock Flints at the Register

> "Keep a blister pack of Zippo flints at the register. When someone's Zippo fails, you want to say 'I can fix that right now' not 'Let me check the back.'"

### Tip 3: Know the Warranty

> "Zippo's lifetime warranty is legendary. When someone's lid breaks, don't sell them a new lighter - tell them about the warranty. They'll appreciate your honesty and buy the Service Kit instead."

### Tip 4: Demo the Windproof Test

> "Light a Zippo, blow on it hard. It won't go out. Then do the same with a BIC. Customer sold."
