# HelixPOS_KB-042: Cheap Lighter Repair SOP - C-Line Maintenance Guide

**The 2-Minute Fix for CHF 1.50 Lighters - When to Repair vs Replace**

---

## Purpose

This KB teaches staff how to:
- Diagnose common issues with cheap plastic lighters
- Replace mini flints (different from Zippo flints!)
- Determine when to repair vs dispose
- Handle the gadget waste box for recycling/rebates
- Explain kid-safe mechanisms to customers
- Upsell to reliable alternatives (Clipper, Zippo)

**Target:** Pam, Ralph, any cashier handling quick repairs

---

## The Dayo Scenario

> *Regular customer walks in with a CHF 1.50 lighter bought yesterday. "No flame, Ralph sold it to me." Pam checks, stuck flint. Quick fix or replace?*

**Decision Tree:**

```
LIGHTER BROKEN?
│
├─ Is it DISPOSABLE (BIC, Cricket)?
│  └─ YES → Don't repair. Give new one. Old one → WASTE BOX
│
├─ Is it REFILLABLE (Mini plastic, Clipper)?
│  ├─ NO FLAME?
│  │  ├─ Check gas level (shake test)
│  │  │  └─ Empty → Refill with GAS-REFILL-MINI (CHF 4.50)
│  │  └─ Has gas but no spark?
│  │     └─ Flint issue → REPAIR (see below)
│  │
│  └─ STUCK FLINT?
│     └─ Try extraction → If fails in 2 min → REPLACE
│
└─ Is it worth more than 5 minutes of labor?
   ├─ YES (customer loyal, teaching moment) → Repair
   └─ NO → Replace with new CHF 1.50 lighter
```

## Mini Flint Replacement (Different from Zippo!)

### Tools Needed

```
REPAIR TOOLKIT (keep at register):
├─ Small flathead screwdriver
├─ Needle-nose pliers (mini)
├─ Toothpicks (for stuck flints)
├─ Magnifying glass (optional)
└─ Waste container
```

**IMPORTANT:** Mini flints are SMALLER than Zippo flints!

| Flint Type | Size | For Use With |
|------------|------|--------------|
| FLINT-MINI-3PK | 2mm x 5mm | Mini plastic lighters |
| FLINT-MINI-LARGE-6PK | 2.5mm x 6mm | Standard refillable |
| ZIPPO-FLINT-6PK | 3mm x 7mm | Zippo ONLY |

---

### Step-by-Step: Mini Lighter Flint Replacement

```
TIME: 2 minutes max (if stuck, give up and replace)

1. LOCATE FLINT CHAMBER
   └─ Usually at base of lighter
   └─ Small screw or push-tab mechanism

2. REMOVE OLD FLINT
   └─ Unscrew chamber carefully
   └─ Tip lighter upside down
   └─ Old flint should fall out

   IF STUCK:
   └─ Use toothpick to gently push
   └─ DO NOT use metal tools (damages plastic)
   └─ If stuck > 2 min → REPLACE LIGHTER

3. INSERT NEW FLINT
   └─ Drop ONE mini flint into chamber
   └─ Ensure correct orientation (round end down)

4. REASSEMBLE
   └─ Screw/click chamber back
   └─ Test spark immediately

5. TEST
   └─ Should spark on first strike
   └─ If no spark → check flint seating
   └─ If still no spark → gas issue, not flint
```

## Disposable vs Refillable Decision

### DISPOSABLE (No Repair - Replace)

| Type | Price | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| BIC Mini | CHF 2.00 | Replace, old → waste box |
| Cricket | CHF 2.50 | Replace, old → waste box |
| Any "single-use" | < CHF 3.00 | Replace |

**Why no repair?**
- No user-serviceable parts
- Sealed gas chamber
- Labor cost > product cost
- Safety: attempting to open can cause leaks

### REFILLABLE (Can Repair)

| Type | Price | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| Mini Lighter Basic | CHF 1.50 | Repair if quick |
| Clipper | CHF 2.50 | Always repair (Clipper has replaceable flint system) |
| Any "refillable" | > CHF 3.00 | Repair |

---

## The Gadget Waste Box

### What Goes In:

```
WASTE BOX (under register):
├─ Empty disposable lighters (BIC, Cricket)
├─ Broken beyond repair lighters
├─ Dead vape batteries (separate compartment!)
├─ Broken cheap grinders
└─ Any small gadget e-waste
```

### Processing:

1. **Weekly Review:** Ralph checks box
2. **Sorting:** Separate by material (plastic, metal, battery)
3. **Supplier Rebates:** Some suppliers accept returns for credit
4. **Recycling:** Proper e-waste disposal for batteries

**NEVER put in regular trash:** Lighters can explode in compactors!

## Kid-Safe Lighter Notes

### Child-Resistant Mechanisms

| Lighter Type | Mechanism | Kid-Safe Rating |
|--------------|-----------|-----------------|
| BIC | Push-down + slide | HIGH |
| Cricket | Push-down + slide | HIGH |
| Clipper | Standard wheel | MEDIUM |
| Mini Basic | Standard wheel | MEDIUM |
| **Zippo** | No mechanism | **NOT KID-SAFE** |

### What to Tell Customers:

> "This BIC has a child-resistant mechanism - you need to push down AND slide to ignite. Zippos don't have this, so keep them away from children."

**Swiss Law Note:** No specific lighter safety law, but EU EN 13869 applies to imports.

---

## Upsell Path: From C-Line to B/A Line

### When customer has repeated C-line issues:

```
PAM'S UPSELL SCRIPT:

"Dayo, I see you're having issues with these cheap lighters.
For CHF 2.50, the Clipper is much more reliable -
it has a replaceable flint system and lasts years.

Or if you want something really solid,
the Zippos start at CHF 35 - lifetime warranty,
and I can teach you to maintain it yourself.

Want to take a look?"
```

### Upsell Products:

| From | To | Price Jump | Pitch |
|------|----|------------|-------|
| Mini Basic (1.50) | Clipper (2.50) | +1.00 | "Replaceable flint, lasts years" |
| Clipper (2.50) | Zippo Black (35.00) | +32.50 | "Lifetime warranty, style" |
| Zippo | Bruce Buster (85.00) | +50.00 | "For cigars, triple torch" |
