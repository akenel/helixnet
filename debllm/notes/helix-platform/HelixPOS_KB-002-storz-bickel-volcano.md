## 💰 Upselling Accessories (Critical for Margin)

### With Every Volcano Sale:

| Accessory | Price | Cost | Margin | Pitch |
|-----------|-------|------|--------|-------|
| **Easy Valve Starter Set** | CHF 49 | CHF 25 | 49% | "Extra bags - you'll need replacements" |
| **Dosing Capsules (40 pack)** | CHF 39 | CHF 18 | 54% | "Pre-fill these, no cleaning" |
| **Cleaning Brush Set** | CHF 15 | CHF 6 | 60% | "Keep it performing like new" |
| **Wear & Tear Kit** | CHF 29 | CHF 12 | 59% | "Screens and O-rings - maintenance" |
| **Magazine (8 capsules)** | CHF 35 | CHF 15 | 57% | "Load a full session in advance" |

### Upsell Script:
> "The Volcano will last 10+ years, but you'll want these accessories. Most customers add the Easy Valve set (CHF 49) and Dosing Capsules (CHF 39) - it makes daily use much easier. Should I add those?"

**Target:** +CHF 80-120 per Volcano sale (16-24% revenue uplift)

---

## ❌ Common Objections & Responses

### "It's too expensive"
**Response:**
> "I understand. A Volcano is an investment. But compare: a CHF 50 bong needs replacing every 1-2 years. A Volcano lasts 10-15 years. That's CHF 50/year vs CHF 500 upfront. And the health benefits of vapor vs smoke are priceless."

---

### "I can get it cheaper online"
**Response:**
> "You might. But consider: if it arrives broken or fails in 6 months, you're shipping it to Germany and waiting 4-6 weeks. Buy from us, walk in with your receipt, we handle everything locally. That peace of mind is worth the few francs difference."

---

### "What if I don't like it?"
**Response:**
> "Storz & Bickel products have a 14-day return policy (unopened) and 3-year warranty. If there's a defect, we replace it. I've sold hundreds of Volcanos - returns are extremely rare because the quality is exceptional."

---

### "Is it complicated to use?"
**Response (Classic):**
> "The Classic? Turn dial, wait 5 minutes, fill balloon, enjoy. That's it. Same operation since 2000."

**Response (Hybrid):**
> "The Hybrid has an app, but you don't need it. The display shows temperature, press start, done. The app is for enthusiasts who want precise control."

---

## 🏆 Felix's Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Demo Unit
> "We keep a Volcano Classic plugged in. When someone asks, I fill a balloon with just air - no herb. They see the bag inflate in 30 seconds. Seeing is believing."

### Tip 2: Show the Craftsmanship
> "Hand them the Mighty+. Let them feel the weight, the build quality. Then hand them a CHF 50 Chinese vape. The difference is obvious."

### Tip 3: Don't Push
> "A CHF 699 sale is great, but a customer who feels pushed won't return. Give them space. 'Take some time, I'm here if you have questions.' They respect that and often buy."

### Tip 4: Know the Competition
> "Pax, DaVinci, Arizer - know their strengths and weaknesses. When customers compare, be honest: 'Pax is sleek and pocketable, but Volcano is unmatched for home sessions.' Honesty sells."
