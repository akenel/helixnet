## The Setup

*First week at Artemis. Survived Black Friday. Felix asks: "What did you learn?"*

---

## What I Expected vs. What I Found

| Expected | Found |
|----------|-------|
| Fancy POS terminal with touchscreen | Laptop with clean web interface |
| Complicated training manual | KBs I could actually read |
| Being thrown in the deep end | Ralph watching my back |
| Boring retail software | Something that feels... alive? |

---

## Day 1: The Overwhelm

I walked in thinking: "Retail job, how hard can it be?"

Then Felix showed me the KB system. I thought it was documentation. But it's more than that. It's like... the shop's brain? Everything Felix and Pam learned over the years, written down.

**First thing I read**: KB-004 (CBD Compliance)

I didn't know Swiss CBD law was so specific. THC under 1%. Age verification. The "meaningful pause." Without that KB, I would have made mistakes on Day 1.

---

## Day 2: The Aha Moment

Ralph asked me to handle a customer alone. Lady wanted a vaporizer. I panicked.

Then I remembered: KB-002 (Volcano Guide).

I pulled it up on my phone. Found the temperature settings. Answered her question. She bought the Volcano Hybrid. CHF 449.

**That's when I understood**: The KBs aren't just for training. They're for DOING.

---

## Day 3: I Made a Mistake

Customer asked about a CBD cream for her grandmother. I said "yes, great for arthritis!"

Pam pulled me aside: "Leandra, we can't make medical claims. Swiss law. Did you read KB-004?"

I had. But I forgot that part.

**Lesson**: Read the KBs. Then read them again. Then read them when you're tired.

---

## Day 4: I Created Something

A customer asked about mixing CBD oils with their coffee. I didn't know, but I found out. Searched online. Asked Ralph. Tested it (off the clock, with my own product).

I wrote it down. Just notes. Ralph said: "That could be a KB."

**Wait, I can CREATE knowledge here?**

Nobody at my last job ever asked me to document what I learned. Here, it's expected. Encouraged. Celebrated?

---

## Day 5: Black Friday

Chaos. Beautiful chaos.

But here's what I noticed:

1. **I wasn't alone** - Ralph was always nearby
2. **I had answers** - The KBs covered 80% of questions
3. **I could check prices** - Inventory was right there
4. **I logged my time** - Just entered start/end, system did the math
5. **I saw my sales** - Real-time, my numbers, my contribution

That Sylvie bag sale (CHF 311)? I remembered KB-021 about the Artisan collection. Described the hand-stitching. Customer loved the story.

**The KB sold the bag. I just delivered it.**

## What HelixNet Is (From Fresh Eyes)

It's NOT:
- A traditional POS (no fancy hardware)
- An ERP system (too simple)
- Just inventory software (too human)
- A training manual (too alive)

It IS:
- **A knowledge system that happens to do sales**
- **A team brain that everyone can read and write to**
- **Simple enough to learn in a week**
- **Deep enough to grow into over years**

---

## What I'd Tell the Next New Hire

1. **Read KB-001 first** (Felix's Headshop 101 - the culture)
2. **Read KB-004 before talking to customers** (Compliance saves you)
3. **Ask Ralph when stuck** (He knows everything)
4. **Ask Pam when Ralph's busy** (She's faster anyway)
5. **Write down what you learn** (It might become a KB)
6. **Don't be afraid of Black Friday** (You'll survive, and you'll grow)

---

## The Feeling

At my last retail job, I was a number. Clock in, scan items, clock out. Nobody cared what I thought.

Here? Felix asked me to speak. At drinks. On a Sunday. About what I LEARNED.

This isn't a job. It's a... system? A family? A way of working?

I don't have a word for it yet. But I want to stay and find out.

## My First KB Contribution (Draft)

**Topic**: Can You Mix CBD Oil in Hot Drinks?

**What I Learned**:
- Yes, but temperature matters
- Above 70°C may degrade CBD
- Coffee: Let it cool slightly first
- Tea: Perfect, usually under 70°C
- Recommend: Add after brewing, not during

**Source**: Personal research + customer questions this week

*Should I make this KB-035?*

*Leandra finishes. The table is quiet. Felix raises his glass.*

**Felix**: "That. THAT is why we built this thing. Prost to Leandra!"

**Everyone**: "PROST! 🍻"
