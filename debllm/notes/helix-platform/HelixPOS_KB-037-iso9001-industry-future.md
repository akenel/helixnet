# KB-037: ISO 9001 and the Future of Cannabis Retail

**Created**: 2024-12-07 (Sit-down with Mosey and Felix)
**Author**: Angel (from Mosey's strategic vision)
**Status**: STRATEGIC - Long-term industry direction

## Mosey's Prediction

> "In 4 years, maybe sooner, we go for ISO 9001 status. It is the way all players will have to be. No ISO 9001, no business."

### What ISO 9001 Requires

| Requirement | What It Means |
|-------------|---------------|
| Document Control | All procedures written, versioned, approved |
| Training Records | Proof staff are trained, when, by whom |
| Traceability | Every product tracked from source to sale |
| Quality Records | Evidence of quality checks |
| Internal Audits | Regular self-assessment |
| Corrective Actions | Documented problem resolution |
| Management Review | Leadership oversight evidence |

## Why This Matters for HelixNet

### The KBs ARE ISO Documentation

```
ISO 9001 Requirement          HelixNet Already Has
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Work Instructions         →   KBs (KB-001 to KB-037)
Training Materials        →   KB-001 Headshop 101
Compliance Procedures     →   KB-004 CBD Swiss Law
Process Documentation     →   KB-010 Age Verification
Error Reporting           →   ERROR-050, ERROR-051
Product Information       →   Product catalog + notes
```

### What We'd Need to Add for ISO 9001

| Gap | Solution |
|-----|----------|
| Version control | KB versioning (v1.0, v1.1...) |
| Approval workflow | KB review + approve process |
| Training records | Log when staff read/complete KBs |
| Audit trail | Timestamp all changes |
| Document numbering | Already have (KB-001, KB-002...) |
| Review dates | Add "next review" to each KB |

---

## The Competitive Advantage

### Shops Without Documentation
- Scramble when regulation hits
- Expensive consultants to build from scratch
- 6-12 months to get compliant
- Many will fail and close

### Shops With HelixNet + KBs
- Documentation already exists
- Staff already trained on procedures
- Audit trail built into system
- 1-2 months to formalize for certification
- Competitive advantage = survival

---

## Mosey's Timeline

| Year | Expected Changes |
|------|------------------|
| Now | Self-regulation, industry best practices |
| 2025 | Increased government oversight |
| 2026 | Mandatory licensing frameworks |
| 2027 | ISO 9001 or equivalent required |
| 2028+ | Non-compliant businesses shut down |

## Mosey's Closing Words

> "The small shops that don't prepare? They'll be gone. The ones with documentation, training, traceability? They'll be the only ones left."

> "Does that make sense, Angel? No ISO 9001, no business."

---

## Felix's Response

> "So all these KBs we've been writing... they're not just for training. They're our survival plan."

**Mosey**: "Now you're thinking like a business owner."

---

*The KBs aren't just knowledge. They're future-proofing.*
